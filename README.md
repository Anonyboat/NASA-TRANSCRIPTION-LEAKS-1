                 1           MR. McALISTER:  Good afternoon and       13:07:54

                 2   welcome to Review of U.S. Human Space Flight     13:07:56

                 3   Plans Committee meeting.  I'm Phil McAlister.    13:08:00

                 4   I'm the executive director of the committee.     13:08:04

                 5   And it's good to see members of the public       13:08:04

                 6   present today.  So welcome to you and all of     13:08:06

                 7   the members watching -- all of the members of    13:08:08

                 8   the public watching on NASA TV and also on       13:08:09

                 9   the Internet.                                    13:08:14

                10           Speaking of the website, the             13:08:14

                11   committee is aware that there will likely be     13:08:14

                12   lots of interest in the presentations today.     13:08:17

                13   The plan is to get them on our website by the    13:08:19

                14   end of the day.  So hopefully we'll have that    13:08:23

                15   up very, very soon, and the website address,     13:08:27

                16   again, is http://hsf.nasa.gov.                   13:08:29

                17           We will also have a press event at       13:08:29

                18   the end the day with Norm Augustine.             13:08:34

                19           The focus of today's meeting will be     13:08:37

                20   on deliberations.  So we are not going to        13:08:40

                21   have a public comment period distinct from       13:08:44

                22   the other public meetings.  But you can still    13:08:46

                23   make a comment to the committee.  Our website    13:08:47

                24   is still active.  We're still receiving          13:08:48

                25   comments.  So we'd like to reserve today for     13:08:51





                                                                 5



                 1   the committee's deliberations since we're        13:08:54

                 2   getting close to end.  But if you do have a      13:08:57

                 3   comment, the committee is still receiving        13:08:57

                 4   those via the website.                           13:09:00

                 5           This meeting is governed by the          13:09:05

                 6   Federal Advisory Committee Act.  So all of       13:09:05

                 7   the presentations today and comments are on      13:09:05

                 8   the record.  Please mute your cell phones,       13:09:05

                 9   and please do not interrupt the committee's      13:09:10

                10   discussions and deliberations.                   13:09:15

                11           With that, the committee chair, Norm     13:09:15

                12   Augustine.                                       13:09:15

                13           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thanks, Phil.            13:09:21

                14           Good afternoon.  Let me welcome          13:09:21

                15   everyone here in the room and also those who     13:09:21

                16   are watching on television or on the Web.        13:09:27

                17   Our committee has 19 days to go before we are    13:09:27

                18   to have completed our task.  We believe we're    13:09:35

                19   on schedule.                                     13:09:35

                20           Today our principal purpose is going     13:09:35

                21   to be to finalize the options that we            13:09:41

                22   presented when we last met a week ago and        13:09:41

                23   also to do an evaluation of them, and I'll       13:09:47

                24   say a little bit more in a moment.               13:09:47

                25           Before I go any further, I want to       13:09:51





                                                                 6



                 1   publicly thank the people at NASA and the        13:09:57

                 2   people at the Aerospace Corporation who have     13:09:57

                 3   been helping us.  No task has been too           13:10:02

                 4   difficult nor too unreasonable even at 3:00      13:10:02

                 5   in the morning, and we're greatly indebted to    13:10:07

                 6   both the NASA folks and the Aerospace folks.     13:10:11

                 7   Their professionalism, their detachment in       13:10:15

                 8   terms of being objective, we could not           13:10:19

                 9   possibly have asked for greater support.         13:10:22

                10           Today the speakers, as you heard,        13:10:22

                11   will be members of the committee.  We had        13:10:26

                12   divided up into subcommittees and then into      13:10:28

                13   little task groups.  And today we'll be          13:10:33

                14   talking about, first, the options that we        13:10:33

                15   will be the providing to the White House and     13:10:38

                16   to NASA.  We will be describing the cost         13:10:38

                17   analysis that's been going on, and we will be    13:10:45

                18   describing the evaluation criteria that we       13:10:48

                19   are going to propose be used to select           13:10:52

                20   options.                                         13:10:56

                21           We ourselves have been asked to          13:10:56

                22   provide options and not recommendations, and     13:11:00

                23   so we'll apply no weightings or no total         13:11:04

                24   tabulations of the weightings, rather, just      13:11:08

                25   try to provide guidelines to the policymakers    13:11:11





                                                                 7



                 1   since those are the people who have to apply     13:11:15

                 2   weightings really given their greater            13:11:17

                 3   perspective than any of us on the committee      13:11:19

                 4   are able to have.                                13:11:22

                 5           And, finally, we will go through the     13:11:25

                 6   evaluations themselves.                          13:11:30

                 7           It's our plan that this be our last      13:11:30

                 8   public meeting.  We had -- we have, though,      13:11:33

                 9   tentatively scheduled, as you may know,          13:11:38

                10   another meeting on the 24th in case that         13:11:38

                11   there are things that need last-minute           13:11:41

                12   cleanup.  I'm a believer, as I've said on        13:11:47

                13   other occasions, the secret to good program      13:11:47

                14   management is to have reserves, and that's       13:11:54

                15   our reserve.                                     13:11:57

                16           At the end of today it's our hope        13:11:58

                17   that we'll have a general -- a good agreement    13:12:00

                18   on the options that we would lay before the      13:12:05

                19   decision makers and an assessment of those       13:12:06

                20   options, but we still have 20 percent of our     13:12:09

                21   90 days remaining before us.  And so we still    13:12:12

                22   have work to day, and the computers are          13:12:17

                23   cranking as we sit here.                         13:12:17

                24           And so there will undoubtedly be         13:12:22

                25   technical changes to the options that will be    13:12:22





                                                                 8



                 1   incorporated in our final report that we         13:12:29

                 2   don't yet have today, but the options            13:12:29

                 3   themselves will be representative of what we     13:12:34

                 4   intend to produce.  But I do caution that if     13:12:34

                 5   there are errors or updated technical            13:12:38

                 6   information or something we, of course, would    13:12:42

                 7   incorporate that in our report.                  13:12:48

                 8           Having said that, the first order of     13:12:48

                 9   business today is to review, once again, the     13:12:48

                10   options that we have been looking at.  Our       13:12:56

                11   colleague Ed Crawley calculated that there       13:12:59

                12   were over 3,000 combinations when we began.      13:13:03

                13   We narrowed that down to 800.  We hope to get    13:13:06

                14   a little below that.                             13:13:11

                15           And so today, Ed, that's your task.      13:13:12

                16           DR. CRAWLEY:  Thank you, Norm.           13:13:15

                17           Well, as Norm has outlined, we're        13:13:18

                18   working, I would say, from above through the     13:13:23

                19   space of possibilities to define the             13:13:25

                20   questions and options that are remaining         13:13:32

                21   before us.  So I'm actually a little bit at a    13:13:34

                22   disadvantage here because I can't read that      13:13:44

                23   monitor and I don't have a paper copy.  So...    13:13:47

                24           (Discussion off the record.)             13:14:15

                25           DR. CRAWLEY:  So the topics of this      13:14:15





                                                                 9



                 1   first discussion, which I'll lead us through,    13:14:21

                 2   which is largely review to set the stage for     13:14:24

                 3   the next three discussions we'll have, I         13:14:27

                 4   guess, to summarize the potential decisions      13:14:30

                 5   and options on human exploration, and this       13:14:33

                 6   will lay the groundwork for the discussion       13:14:36

                 7   that will immediately follow me from Sally       13:14:43

                 8   Ride on the costing and scheduling work that     13:14:43

                 9   has been done to date on these by the            13:14:47

                10   combination of the Aerospace and NASA team.      13:14:47

                11   And then my colleague Wanda Austin will          13:14:52

                12   present the framework in which we're going to    13:14:56

                13   evaluate these.  And then there will be a        13:14:56

                14   committee discussion of the actual evaluation    13:14:59

                15   process that will follow that.                   13:15:01

                16           So just to quickly summarize, we've      13:15:02

                17   reduced the number of questions that a           13:15:06

                18   policymaker would face in resolving this         13:15:09

                19   issue of the future of human space flight now    13:15:15

                20   down to five by reflecting on the                13:15:15

                21   deliberations that occurred at the last          13:15:17

                22   public meeting and simplifying and combining     13:15:21

                23   some things.                                     13:15:25

                24           So essentially the questions are:        13:15:27

                25   What's the phaseout plan of the shuttle?         13:15:27





                                                                10



                 1   Should it fly out the remainder of the           13:15:32

                 2   flights safely -- that would be the minimum      13:15:32

                 3   that we would recommend -- or that we should     13:15:32

                 4   extend it one or two shuttle flights per year    13:15:32

                 5   through about '15, which would likely only be    13:15:40

                 6   a desirable idea if it was done in               13:15:40

                 7   conjunction with a tightly shuttle-derived       13:15:48

                 8   vehicle used for heavy lift?                     13:15:48

                 9           Then second:  What's the future of       13:15:54

                10   the ISS?  Should we retire it as planned --      13:15:54

                11   from the U.S. human space flight planned in      13:15:54

                12   '15 or extend it to '20?  So -- oh, I'm          13:15:54

                13   sorry.  That was the chart I just covered.       13:16:05

                14   So we'll synchronize here in a moment.           13:16:05

                15           So I'm just going to have a quick        13:16:14

                16   chart or so on the possible variance of these    13:16:14

                17   decisions that we're still considering.          13:16:14

                18           There is, as it is shown by NASA,        13:16:23

                19   little margin left in the shuttle schedule,      13:16:23

                20   and there's broad agreement that the             13:16:23

                21   important thing to do is to fly the remaining    13:16:32

                22   flights safely on a schedule that will unfold    13:16:32

                23   from flight to flight and that we estimate       13:16:32

                24   that this will go sometime at least into         13:16:44

                25   fiscal year '11, if not into calendar year       13:16:44





                                                                11



                 1   '11.  It's the safe and appropriate thing to     13:16:44

                 2   do, and we recommend nothing other than doing    13:16:53

                 3   this at a minimum.                               13:16:53

                 4           The only problem with this is, of        13:16:53

                 5   course, that the additional funding in FY '11    13:16:53

                 6   to extend the lifetime of the shuttle            13:16:53

                 7   transportation -- the space transportation       13:16:53

                 8   system is not currently in the budget.  So at    13:17:08

                 9   an absolute minimum, we will recommend that      13:17:08

                10   that be included.                                13:17:08

                11           Then the question arises:  Should we     13:17:08

                12   so-called "close the gap" from below and         13:17:08

                13   extend the shuttle to about 2015 or sometime     13:17:30

                14   in the mid decade, by which time some other      13:17:30

                15   U.S. based capability would be available to      13:17:30

                16   fly to the ISS?  We think that this can be       13:17:30

                17   done safely at a flight of one to two flights    13:17:30

                18   a year, that this would make sense               13:17:30

                19   economically if tightly coupled with a           13:17:30

                20   heavy-lift option that most directly built on    13:17:52

                21   the shuttle heritage.                            13:17:52

                22           It would reduce the gap.  It would       13:17:52

                23   support the continuing utilization of the        13:17:52

                24   International Space Station, which was, in       13:17:52

                25   fact, designed assuming that the shuttle was     13:17:52





                                                                12



                 1   available for a logistics carrier.  It would     13:17:52

                 2   smooth some workforce transitions, and it        13:17:52

                 3   would take maximum advantage of existing         13:18:10

                 4   infrastructure.                                  13:18:10

                 5           However, it is not in the budget as      13:18:10

                 6   defined by the President or by NASA going        13:18:10

                 7   into this point, and it would require the        13:18:10

                 8   extension of the shuttle systems throughout      13:18:10

                 9   this approximately five-year period, which       13:18:10

                10   would, of course, impact all of the other        13:18:10

                11   plans that are also in the budget.               13:18:31

                12           In addition, there's a technical         13:18:31

                13   issue, which is that, although the shuttle       13:18:31

                14   has been -- gone through phased reviews of       13:18:31

                15   its continuing airworthiness or flight           13:18:31

                16   worthiness, there would be -- we would           13:18:31

                17   recommend some additional NASA and               13:18:31

                18   independent risk assessment associated with      13:18:31

                19   the technical issues, aside from the             13:18:31

                20   budgetary and programmatic issues, of            13:18:56

                21   extending the shuttle lifetime.                  13:18:56

                22           Did I say that about right?              13:18:56

                23           DR. RIDE:  Yes, sir.                     13:18:56

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.                      13:18:56

                25           (Discussion off the record.)             13:18:56





                                                                13



                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  So I'm now on ISS to       13:18:56

                 2   2015, which is one more.  There we go.           13:19:21

                 3           So that's really the two options that    13:19:21

                 4   we're considering in the shuttle, retire it      13:19:21

                 5   in a workmanlike manner when the existing        13:19:21

                 6   flights are flown out in probably '11 or         13:19:21

                 7   extend it to about '15.                          13:19:21

                 8           Now, we come to the next decision,       13:19:21

                 9   which is:  What's the plan for the ISS?  And     13:19:21

                10   here the, if you will, reference decision is     13:19:48

                11   to continue with the historical plan -- that     13:19:48

                12   is to say, the plan which is in the current      13:19:48

                13   budget -- of ending primary U.S. support for     13:19:48

                14   the ISS in 2015 and that we would focus, to      13:19:48

                15   the greatest extent possible, the work there     13:19:48

                16   on both the continuing science and the           13:19:48

                17   preparation for exploration, that the            13:19:48

                18   resupply and logistics between now and then      13:19:48

                19   would likely be through the international        13:20:25

                20   partners and through the commercial              13:20:25

                21   transportation services contract; that is to     13:20:25

                22   say, that its our view that it is unlikely       13:20:25

                23   that any other U.S. based capability, either     13:20:25

                24   government or commercially provided, would       13:20:25

                25   so-called "close the gap" from above, that is    13:20:25





                                                                14



                 1   to say, would be available substantially         13:20:25

                 2   before 2015.                                     13:20:25

                 3           If we proceed with this, it would        13:20:25

                 4   require -- since the International Space         13:20:25

                 5   Station is truly an international endeavor,      13:20:51

                 6   it would require an agreement among the          13:20:51

                 7   partners for the either extension or             13:20:51

                 8   decommissioning and the retirement of the        13:20:51

                 9   station.  And what this essentially -- this      13:20:51

                10   option would essentially probably lead to is     13:20:51

                11   the retirement and de-orbit of the ISS in        13:20:51

                12   2016, our view being that it is unlikely that    13:20:51

                13   there is a managerial solution or a non-U.S.     13:21:16

                14   lead user solution that would allow the          13:21:16

                15   station to function in a robust way without      13:21:16

                16   the involvement of the United States             13:21:16

                17   government.                                      13:21:16

                18           So essentially we have not found a       13:21:16

                19   desirable solution which is -- allows the        13:21:16

                20   space station to continue past '15 but           13:21:38

                21   without the United States being the lead user    13:21:38

                22   and carrying that line within the budget,        13:21:38

                23   although we looked hard.                         13:21:38

                24           The alternative is to extend the ISS     13:21:38

                25   until about 2020 or at least until 2020,         13:21:53





                                                                15



                 1   which would allow what we are calling            13:21:53

                 2   enhanced U.S. participation.  In the             13:21:53

                 3   budgeting for this, we've actually put in a      13:21:53

                 4   more robust budget line for utilization of       13:22:08

                 5   the space station, and this would show to our    13:22:08

                 6   partners a full commitment to utilize the        13:22:08

                 7   space station at least through the first         13:22:08

                 8   decade of their presence, many of whom only      13:22:08

                 9   placed their laboratory modules on orbit in      13:22:17

                10   the last year or so, that this would provide     13:22:17

                11   additional opportunities for international       13:22:22

                12   partnership, one can imagine, including new      13:22:22

                13   partners and using the ISS partnership as an     13:22:25

                14   evolving mechanism by which a more standing      13:22:29

                15   partnership -- a more established partnership    13:22:33

                16   would then be transitioned from the use of       13:22:36

                17   the ISS to a partnership for exploration.        13:22:42

                18   This is something that the international         13:22:45

                19   partners have said to us they think would be     13:22:47

                20   a desirable path.                                13:22:51

                21           In this case, there would be an          13:22:51

                22   extensive utilization of the ISS, both from a    13:22:54

                23   human physiology perspective and from an         13:22:54

                24   engineering development perspective, to lay      13:23:02

                25   the groundwork for exploration.  Things like     13:23:02





                                                                16



                 1   the development of cryogenic fuel handling       13:23:04

                 2   and transfer in zero gravity would be --         13:23:11

                 3   would likely to be developed and tested on       13:23:14

                 4   the station through this enhanced utilization    13:23:16

                 5   program.                                         13:23:20

                 6           And this option is actually more         13:23:20

                 7   consistent with the existing national policy     13:23:24

                 8   of viewing the ISS as a national laboratory.     13:23:27

                 9   However, it is not consistent with the           13:23:31

                10   existing budget which does not contain           13:23:34

                11   funding for the space station past 2015 and,     13:23:36

                12   in fact, probably also does not contain          13:23:41

                13   enough money to retire this -- to retire --      13:23:41

                14   that is to say, de-orbit the space station in    13:23:44

                15   2015 or '16 if that were the choice.             13:23:47

                16           So in our -- as Sally will discuss,      13:23:53

                17   we've appropriately put in reserves into all     13:23:53

                18   of our budgeting exercises for either the        13:23:58

                19   extension or the orderly de-orbit of the         13:24:02

                20   space station.                                   13:24:05

                21           So that covers the decisions -- the      13:24:07

                22   first two decisions, what to do with the         13:24:10

                23   shuttle and what to do with the ISS.             13:24:14

                24           Now, these two are somewhat closely      13:24:14

                25   coupled because they basically have to do        13:24:16





                                                                17



                 1   with launch into low Earth orbit and the         13:24:19

                 2   servicing of crew in low Earth orbit.            13:24:23

                 3           The first one is should the              13:24:26

                 4   government develop launch -- should the          13:24:28

                 5   government-developed launch system be based      13:24:31

                 6   on NASA, slash, shuttle heritage or an           13:24:32

                 7   EELV-based system.  So we essentially are now    13:24:36

                 8   carrying four choices for that decision.         13:24:41

                 9           The program of record, the Ares I        13:24:43

                10   plus Ares V without any explicit considering     13:24:47

                11   of on-orbit refueling, a proposal that           13:24:50

                12   actually came from the program that we           13:24:53

                13   slightly scaled back the capabilities of the     13:24:58

                14   Ares V to what we call the Ares V Lite, to       13:25:01

                15   keep it simple.  There is an official program    13:25:06

                16   designation for this.                            13:25:06

                17           And you would use this, for example,     13:25:10

                18   on lunar missions in a dual launch scenario      13:25:10

                19   where two launches of the heavy-launch           13:25:15

                20   vehicle rather than a launch of the Ares I       13:25:15

                21   and the Ares V would be used to support lunar    13:25:18

                22   missions.  And in this one, importantly the      13:25:23

                23   Ares V would become human rated or at least      13:25:23

                24   human ratable.  And this option would be         13:25:27

                25   enhanced with potentially commercially           13:25:29





                                                                18



                 1   supplied refueling in low Earth orbit -- at      13:25:31

                 2   least initially in low Earth orbit.              13:25:33

                 3           The third principal option here is       13:25:35

                 4   the directly shuttle-derived vehicle, one        13:25:38

                 5   that would be either side mount or inline but    13:25:42

                 6   would trace more directly to the NASA            13:25:45

                 7   heritage of engines, SRBs, external tank and     13:25:48

                 8   so forth which also could be potentially         13:25:53

                 9   enhanced with on-orbit refueling.                13:25:56

                10           And the last option we are carrying      13:25:59

                11   is an EELV heavy -- an EELV super heavy --       13:26:03

                12   I'm sorry -- something in the 75-metric-ton      13:26:06

                13   category, which is really a placeholder for a    13:26:11

                14   more generic hydrocarbon-based rocket which      13:26:17

                15   would have a LOX/kerosene first stage and        13:26:17

                16   high energy LOX/hydrogen upper stages,           13:26:20

                17   something along the layout of -- not             13:26:23

                18   necessarily the physical layout but the fuel     13:26:24

                19   choices that were used in the Saturn V.  And     13:26:28

                20   it, too, could be potentially enhanced by        13:26:32

                21   commercial refueling.                            13:26:35

                22           So you'll see that in actually all of    13:26:37

                23   the cases but the baseline, the first one, we    13:26:39

                24   are considering recommending that the            13:26:41

                25   technology for on-orbit fuel transfer of the     13:26:45





                                                                19



                 1   appropriate fuels, in all cases LOX/hydrogen,    13:26:48

                 2   be developed as a technology item so that it     13:26:49

                 3   would eventually be available to either          13:26:54

                 4   increase the throw mass from low Earth orbit     13:26:56

                 5   of the smaller stages or enhance the throw       13:26:59

                 6   mass from low Earth orbit of the larger          13:27:01

                 7   stages.                                          13:27:02

                 8           MR. GREASON:  I think there's a          13:27:08

                 9   business model choice that's embedded in that    13:27:10

                10   too, not just the technology item.               13:27:14

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  And I'll get to     13:27:14

                12   that in another chart.  Thank you, Jeff.         13:27:15

                13           And then the other question is:  How     13:27:17

                14   should the crew be carried, on U.S.              13:27:17

                15   government-provided systems or by commercial     13:27:20

                16   and internationals?                              13:27:22

                17           And in this latter case, it implies      13:27:24

                18   that we think that the U.S. government should    13:27:29

                19   maintain an option for the future of being       13:27:29

                20   able to fly crew to low Earth orbit in the       13:27:32

                21   case that either, for one reason or another,     13:27:38

                22   the internationals or the commercials do not     13:27:42

                23   materialize or are no longer interested or       13:27:48

                24   able to carry them but that what we've           13:27:48

                25   decided to recommend is that this an             13:27:48





                                                                20



                 1   operational backup, that is to say, that         13:27:57

                 2   whatever the vehicle that is chosen in answer    13:27:57

                 3   to Question 3 should maintain the capability     13:27:57

                 4   of at least being human ratable without a        13:28:07

                 5   great deal of additional investment.  So         13:28:07

                 6   there would be some cost in both performance     13:28:07

                 7   and money to doing that, but it would retain     13:28:20

                 8   for the United States the option of having       13:28:20

                 9   our government provide access to low Earth       13:28:20

                10   orbit.                                           13:28:20

                11           So in a little more detail here are      13:28:20

                12   the options.  This is the Ares I plus Ares V.    13:28:20

                13   This is essentially the program of record,       13:28:32

                14   about a 26-ton vehicle and about a 160-ton       13:28:32

                15   vehicle using NASA heritage components.          13:28:32

                16           Oh, I'm sorry.  Thank you.  Just bug     13:28:32

                17   me, Leroy, when I forget that.                   13:28:44

                18           That the Ares I would be the crew        13:28:44

                19   transportation to ISS and Earth orbit, that      13:28:44

                20   in the lunar and other out of LEO missions it    13:28:44

                21   would rendezvous with the Ares V crewed          13:28:44

                22   flights, and the Ares V by itself would be       13:28:57

                23   used in cargo flights.                           13:28:57

                24           A slight variant of that, as I           13:28:57

                25   mentioned, is the one proposed by the program    13:28:57





                                                                21



                 1   to simplify or scale back the design of the      13:28:57

                 2   Ares V a little bit, going from five and a       13:29:12

                 3   half to five segments, from RS-68B's to          13:29:12

                 4   RS-68A engines.  This reduces the performance    13:29:12

                 5   a little bit but still keeps it in this sort     13:29:12

                 6   of super, super heavy class.                     13:29:31

                 7           But along with this, you would           13:29:31

                 8   redesign the mode for lunar exploration to be    13:29:31

                 9   the so-called dual launch where -- well,         13:29:31

                10   there are various manifesting options.  I        13:29:31

                11   won't go into that detail.                       13:29:31

                12           But as a crew -- as a cargo vehicle,     13:29:31

                13   now, you would launch one Ares V, and in         13:29:31

                14   crewed missions you would launch two in a        13:29:56

                15   dual mode.  And there are options here for       13:29:56

                16   the rendezvous occurring either in Earth         13:29:56

                17   orbit or in lunar orbit, which is a matter of    13:29:56

                18   some details of the balancing of the payload     13:29:56

                19   on the two launch vehicles.                      13:29:56

                20           We have costed and are still             13:29:56

                21   considering a directly shuttle-derived           13:29:56

                22   vehicle as an option, and we have not made --    13:29:56

                23           MR. BEJMUK:  Ed, would you call --       13:30:38

                24   excuse me, Ed.  Would you call by numbers so     13:30:38

                25   these folks can, you know, cycle the charts.     13:30:38





                                                                22



                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  I'm sorry.                 13:30:38

                 2           MR. BEJMUK:  Thank you.                  13:30:38

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  So that was Chart 10       13:30:38

                 4   that I was just referring to.  Now we're         13:30:38

                 5   going to 11, Shuttle Derived Vehicle.            13:30:38

                 6           In this case we have examined            13:30:38

                 7   conceptually and still keep in the trade         13:30:38

                 8   space both the sidemount and inline              13:30:38

                 9   shuttle-derived vehicles because we do not       13:30:38

                10   feel that within the scope of this study we      13:30:38

                11   are likely to directly recommend that one or     13:30:38

                12   the other is the likely desirable vehicle if     13:31:12

                13   this class of launch vehicles remains in our     13:31:12

                14   recommendation.  That's simply too detailed      13:31:12

                15   an engineering study that a panel of this        13:31:12

                16   size, even with the support of NASA and          13:31:12

                17   outside contractors, would be able to do         13:31:12

                18   during this time frame.                          13:31:12

                19           However, we have kept it in the trade    13:31:12

                20   space as a generic option of a vehicle which     13:31:12

                21   is directly shuttle derived and has              13:31:12

                22   performance in the range of 100 metric tons      13:31:12

                23   to LEO and that neither of these would           13:31:50

                24   necessarily be human rated and that, in fact,    13:31:50

                25   we would use a commercial crew transport to      13:31:50





                                                                23



                 1   bring the crew to low Earth orbit and            13:31:50

                 2   transfer into the heavy-lift vehicles and        13:31:50

                 3   their payloads and inject out of low Earth       13:31:50

                 4   orbit.                                           13:31:50

                 5           So I guess this is an appropriate        13:31:50

                 6   point to observe that there is a strong          13:31:50

                 7   consensus that the government -- the             13:31:50

                 8   United States should support a vigorous          13:31:50

                 9   program of developing a commercial crew          13:32:20

                10   transportation launch vehicle and capsule        13:32:20

                11   that would be used, for example, in this         13:32:20

                12   scenario, and it would be the likely crew        13:32:20

                13   transportation system from the United States     13:32:20

                14   in the event that we extend the space station    13:32:20

                15   beyond 2015, so, thereby, creating, in           13:32:20

                16   addition to the COTS cargo capacity which is     13:32:20

                17   currently under development, an additional       13:32:20

                18   broadly based commercial opportunity to          13:32:43

                19   supply launch vehicles and capsules for crew     13:32:43

                20   and that this would be an open competition       13:32:43

                21   with good specifications written by the          13:32:43

                22   government and a largely commercially            13:32:43

                23   provided service.                                13:32:43

                24           This is consistent with the              13:32:43

                25   discussion that the panel has had at several     13:32:43





                                                                24



                 1   of its previous meetings that the appropriate    13:33:00

                 2   task for NASA is to do the hard things, to       13:33:00

                 3   develop the new technologies.  And, in fact,     13:33:00

                 4   going back to a model which is in the            13:33:00

                 5   predecessor of NASA, the NACA, one of the        13:33:00

                 6   primary roles of the NACA was to develop         13:33:00

                 7   technology which was then transferred to         13:33:22

                 8   commercial industry and that appeared in both    13:33:22

                 9   military and civil aircraft.  And we think       13:33:22

                10   that a reinvigoration of this -- the hard        13:33:22

                11   job, the development of the big new vehicles     13:33:22

                12   and the technology to support the commercial     13:33:22

                13   exploitation of space is an appropriate task     13:33:22

                14   for NASA in the years ahead.                     13:33:22

                15           This crew transportation vehicle         13:33:39

                16   would also be used alongside a                   13:33:39

                17   LOX/kerosene-based EELV super-heavy vehicle      13:33:39

                18   in the 75-ton range, and, again, the             13:33:39

                19   commercial vehicle would transport the crew      13:33:39

                20   to the ISS and do Earth rendezvous.  There       13:33:39

                21   are several options for the super heavy with     13:33:59

                22   the LOX/RP-1 based first stage, and we do not    13:33:59

                23   intend to necessarily advocate any one of        13:33:59

                24   those potential routes for acquisition -- or     13:33:59

                25   any one of the routes to a particular            13:34:16





                                                                25



                 1   vehicle, that this is a generic class that       13:34:16

                 2   we're considering.                               13:34:16

                 3           For the Moon, the crew missions for a    13:34:16

                 4   vehicle of this class are likely to consist      13:34:16

                 5   of the crew taxi and two or three launches,      13:34:16

                 6   depending on the exact design of the lunar       13:34:32

                 7   system that follows, and the cargo is one or     13:34:32

                 8   maybe as many as two launches to provide the     13:34:32

                 9   logistics train to the lunar surface and to      13:34:32

                10   other destinations beyond low Earth orbit.       13:34:32

                11           MR. BEJMUK:  Ed, may I make a            13:34:54

                12   comment.  I think it's absolutely essential      13:34:54

                13   that if NASA undertakes this competition for     13:34:54

                14   crew access to LEO that there is -- that         13:34:54

                15   competition is structured in such a way that     13:34:54

                16   not only the newcomers into this business can    13:34:54

                17   compete but also our best and most               13:35:15

                18   experienced companies can likewise               13:35:15

                19   participate.                                     13:35:15

                20           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     13:35:15

                21           MR. BEJMUK:  Because they'll give us     13:35:15

                22   assurance that we will have reliable access      13:35:15

                23   to space by our crews, so -- and it's going      13:35:15

                24   to be -- it's going to require a very wise,      13:35:15

                25   very smart structuring of this competition.      13:35:15





                                                                26



                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  Absolutely.        13:35:32

                 2   That's a broad consensus of the committee, I     13:35:32

                 3   would say.                                       13:35:32

                 4           Okay.  The last point on                 13:35:32

                 5   transportation is that we have spent a fair      13:35:32

                 6   amount of time thinking about the                13:35:32

                 7   opportunities that are created by either         13:35:32

                 8   refueling with a single tanker the upper         13:35:32

                 9   stages on orbit or refueling from a depot of     13:35:47

                10   Earth departure stages in orbit.  This is not    13:35:47

                11   new idea, as Jeff showed at our meeting last     13:35:47

                12   week -- wherever it was -- was it here -- oh,    13:35:47

                13   it was in Cocoa Beach, I think -- a famous       13:36:00

                14   quote from von Braun, who, in fact, had          13:36:00

                15   imagined this operational concept, as he did     13:36:00

                16   many, and advocated it -- that in the tanker     13:36:00

                17   mode, which is slightly simpler, a single        13:36:10

                18   tanker is launched to orbit.                     13:36:10

                19           In the depot mode, a more                13:36:15

                20   semipermanent or permanent depot exists and,     13:36:15

                21   in that case, becomes the fuel tank in space.    13:36:15

                22   It becomes the repository for smaller or         13:36:22

                23   medium size vehicles, which could also be        13:36:22

                24   commercially supplied or commercially            13:36:30

                25   delivered fuel to orbit, to come up, meet        13:36:30





                                                                27



                 1   with the depot transfer fuel.  And then          13:36:30

                 2   there's an autonomous rendezvous -- which        13:36:42

                 3   would be an autonomous rendezvous to fuel        13:36:42

                 4   transfer, and then the eventual cargo stage      13:36:42

                 5   that is tanked would come up and rendezvous      13:36:51

                 6   with the depot.                                  13:36:51

                 7           This is the KC-135/KC-10 in the sky.     13:36:51

                 8   It's exactly the same concept.  You enhance      13:37:04

                 9   the capability of the vehicles by                13:37:04

                10   independently having fuel arrive there and       13:37:04

                11   transferred to them.                             13:37:04

                12           The advantages of this are that for a    13:37:04

                13   given upper stage or departure stage you can     13:37:04

                14   significantly, probably by at least a factor     13:37:21

                15   of two, increase the throw capability away       13:37:21

                16   from the Earth -- important if we plan to        13:37:21

                17   explore -- or you can take it out in design      13:37:21

                18   and build a smaller Earth departure stage and    13:37:21

                19   resulting booster and be able to inject an       13:37:33

                20   equal amount of mass out of low Earth orbit.     13:37:33

                21           The disadvantages are that the           13:37:33

                22   operations become more complex.  There are       13:37:33

                23   more launches for a single event.  There are     13:37:33

                24   some isolation of that problem by putting in     13:37:33

                25   a depot so that the flights to the depot         13:37:45





                                                                28



                 1   become decoupled from the flights out of low     13:37:45

                 2   Earth orbit.  There are technologies which       13:37:45

                 3   have to be developed.                            13:38:00

                 4           And this is a good point to mention      13:38:00

                 5   also that it's a strong feeling of the           13:38:00

                 6   committee that in any budget that we go          13:38:00

                 7   forward with that a significant investment in    13:38:00

                 8   new technology for space should included.        13:38:00

                 9           So this creates -- this is the answer    13:38:15

                10   to your comment, Jeff.                           13:38:15

                11           This creates a basically third           13:38:15

                12   potential market for commercial development      13:38:15

                13   of space, the first being the existing cargo     13:38:15

                14   supply to the space station, the second being    13:38:25

                15   the potential of commercial crew to low Earth    13:38:25

                16   orbit and the third being the delivery of        13:38:25

                17   fuel to a tanker or depot.  So this creates      13:38:35

                18   the possibility of a business model, as Jeff     13:38:35

                19   mentioned, which creates a fairly robust and     13:38:45

                20   dynamic demand for domestic commercial           13:38:45

                21   providers of launch services to space.           13:38:45

                22           MR. GREASON:  While I completely         13:38:54

                23   agree with all of that, the point I was          13:38:54

                24   trying to mention earlier is, I think, in our    13:38:54

                25   internal deliberations that when we've           13:38:54





                                                                29



                 1   discussed the various 75-ton class               13:39:03

                 2   alternatives it's not just a technology          13:39:03

                 3   choice about which fuel you put in the first     13:39:03

                 4   stage, we're also looking at sort of a "make"    13:39:09

                 5   versus "buy" model.                              13:39:09

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yes.  Right.  And          13:39:09

                 7   you're absolutely right.  I was going to let     13:39:14

                 8   Sally explain that.                              13:39:18

                 9           Got that, Sally?                         13:39:18

                10           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  Thank you.             13:39:22

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, let me expand on     13:39:25

                12   what Jeff has said -- is that within the         13:39:27

                13   class of vehicles which does not rely            13:39:28

                14   directly on shuttle and NASA heritage, which     13:39:32

                15   would be -- if you go to Chart 10 -- would be    13:39:36

                16   either the Ares family or on Chart 11 the        13:39:42

                17   shuttle-derived family.                          13:39:48

                18           Essentially if those are the launch      13:39:49

                19   vehicles of choice, the business model is --     13:39:51

                20   the current business model, which is that        13:39:54

                21   these are NASA-derived vehicles built, at        13:39:57

                22   least in part, in NASA-maintained and            13:40:00

                23   operated facilities, the choice of the           13:40:03

                24   heavy -- the heavy hydrocarbon, which is more    13:40:06

                25   aligned with the existing EELV and commercial    13:40:10





                                                                30



                 1   launch infrastructure, creates the               13:40:16

                 2   opportunity for the alternative business         13:40:19

                 3   model that the launch services are largely       13:40:21

                 4   acquired in a more commercial mode by NASA       13:40:24

                 5   even for the heavy-lift vehicles and...          13:40:25

                 6           Is that the point?                       13:40:32

                 7           MR. GREASON:  Yes.                       13:40:36

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  And Dr. Ride will          13:40:36

                 9   comment on the economic and other                13:40:39

                10   considerations of that in her comments.          13:40:40

                11           MR. BEJMUK:  Ed, just, you know, yes,    13:40:46

                12   you stated it as an opportunity.  But there      13:40:48

                13   is also a flip side to it.  We, in America,      13:40:53

                14   have gone hydrogen-oxygen for a long time.       13:41:05

                15   We have gotten good at it.  We have gone         13:41:05

                16   solid booster for the first stage where          13:41:05

                17   thrust is very important, less so than ISP,      13:41:18

                18   and we have gotten good at that.                 13:41:18

                19           And today to recommend that we are       13:41:18

                20   transitioning from this well-honed,              13:41:18

                21   well-developed know-how and thinking this is     13:41:18

                22   going to be a picnic, undertaking what the       13:41:29

                23   Russians have actually been very good at, we     13:41:29

                24   are not stating all of the pitfalls, and we      13:41:29

                25   need to be clear that this requires              13:41:41





                                                                31



                 1   abandoning what we have become good at and       13:41:41

                 2   undertaking development of new things.           13:41:41

                 3           In fact, you know, a number of years     13:41:41

                 4   ago when the question came of getting a          13:41:53

                 5   hydrocarbon engine for Atlas, we had to go to    13:41:53

                 6   Russia to buy one because we did not have        13:41:53

                 7   sufficient efficient technology to do it         13:41:53

                 8   ourselves.  So we have to be -- we have to       13:42:03

                 9   walk into this new opportunity with open         13:42:03

                10   eyes.                                            13:42:03

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  That's absolutely          13:42:03

                12   correct.  And as all of us know, the likely      13:42:03

                13   first stage engine for this, in the absence      13:42:11

                14   of a large new American LOX/kerosene engine      13:42:11

                15   development, would be the RD-180 engine, a       13:42:20

                16   Russian-supplied engine.                         13:42:27

                17           So that in our consideration of this,    13:42:27

                18   we're also factoring in, as you know, the        13:42:27

                19   cost and schedule risk of developing a           13:42:27

                20   domestic, large LOX/kerosene engine of a         13:42:36

                21   comparable class, let's say.  And we             13:42:36

                22   definitely understand -- your point is well      13:42:42

                23   taken, that for the last several decades the     13:42:46

                24   United States has used as the high thrust --     13:42:46

                25   not necessarily the highest ISP option for       13:42:51





                                                                32



                 1   launch from the ground -- it certainly is in     13:42:55

                 2   the civil program -- a combination of            13:42:59

                 3   LOX/hydrogen and solids, and this would be a     13:42:59

                 4   different route.                                 13:43:04

                 5           The last of the decisions which is:      13:43:05

                 6   What is the first destination for exploration    13:43:09

                 7   beyond LEO?  We've tried to boil down into       13:43:11

                 8   these four, the Moon with surface                13:43:15

                 9   exploration -- 14.  I'm sorry.  Right.  14.      13:43:17

                10   Back one.                                        13:43:20

                11           What's the first destination for         13:43:20

                12   exploration beyond LEO?  The Moon with           13:43:30

                13   surface exploration focused on a base or on      13:43:33

                14   sorties which then move towards the              13:43:42

                15   development of a base; Moon with surface         13:43:42

                16   exploration focused on slightly more on the      13:43:44

                17   global exploration, more of a scouting and       13:43:44

                18   reconnaissance and establishment of shorter      13:43:49

                19   term bases; deep space, that is to say,          13:43:52

                20   visiting the nearby planetary bodies up to       13:43:57

                21   and including flybys of Mars without any         13:43:58

                22   immediate exploration of the planetary           13:44:02

                23   surface but with the use of robotics in          13:44:04

                24   coordination; and then an option which goes      13:44:08

                25   first to Mars.                                   13:44:11





                                                                33



                 1           So, Norm, today we're down to 128, if    13:44:11

                 2   you counted that up.                             13:44:15

                 3           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Keep going.              13:44:18

                 4           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  By the end of       13:44:21

                 5   the day.                                         13:44:21

                 6           So I'll just give us a few words         13:44:21

                 7   about each one of these.  These are not          13:44:27

                 8   significantly changed from the presentation      13:44:27

                 9   that we made at Cocoa Beach several weeks        13:44:31

                10   ago.  Chart 15.                                  13:44:35

                11           So the one which we loosely call         13:44:35

                12   Lunar Base, which, in fact, is sorties which     13:44:43

                13   likely leads to Lunar Base, which is             13:44:43

                14   approximately the approach of the program of     13:44:47

                15   record, the Constellation program, is that       13:44:47

                16   there would be first sorties to the lunar        13:44:50

                17   surface and then extended stays, building up     13:44:54

                18   the capability of a permanent human presence     13:44:56

                19   of crew on the lunar surface at a base-like      13:44:59

                20   facility in rotations of about 190 days, much    13:45:05

                21   like the crew rotation is today on the ISS;      13:45:10

                22   that there would be mobility from this site      13:45:14

                23   which should be likely in the range of a         13:45:14

                24   hundred or hundreds of kilometers, which         13:45:19

                25   sounds like a long way to drive on the lunar     13:45:25





                                                                34



                 1   surface but, in fact, does not allow you to      13:45:25

                 2   cover a very large fraction of the lunar         13:45:29

                 3   surface as exploration, one of the deficits      13:45:29

                 4   of this strategy; that since you're at a         13:45:34

                 5   pole, you're able to get insulation from the     13:45:36

                 6   Sun to generate solar power through the lunar    13:45:39

                 7   night -- it's a little like being at the         13:45:43

                 8   South Pole on the Equinox, the Sun is more or    13:45:47

                 9   less always on the horizon, so that you can      13:45:51

                10   find locations that will allow you to            13:45:51

                11   generate electrical power most of the time;      13:45:53

                12   that habitation would be provided by a           13:45:56

                13   concept not unlike the ISS with modules that     13:45:59

                14   are offloaded from landers and linked            13:46:03

                15   together; and that the emphasis in this would    13:46:06

                16   be understanding the lunar environment and       13:46:09

                17   its applicability to future human exploration    13:46:13

                18   to develop the long-stay human physiology        13:46:18

                19   information, to learn how to scout and to        13:46:18

                20   move mobily on a planetary surface other than    13:46:25

                21   ours.                                            13:46:25

                22           There is interesting planetary           13:46:25

                23   geology to do on the Moon that would be a        13:46:31

                24   prime objective of the science campaign,         13:46:31

                25   reliability in the systems, the suits, the       13:46:37





                                                                35



                 1   rovers, the airlocks and a systematic testing    13:46:37

                 2   approach of our capability to live on a          13:46:44

                 3   distant planetary surface but one that is not    13:46:50

                 4   so distant that within a few days you            13:46:50

                 5   couldn't get back to the home planet.            13:46:54

                 6           The architecture that goes with this     13:46:54

                 7   is fairly well understood.  Next chart, 16.      13:46:59

                 8           It's basically the program of            13:47:02

                 9   reference architecture, that there would be a    13:47:07

                10   launch and a half -- that is to say, an          13:47:07

                11   Ares I and an Ares V -- that rendezvous in       13:47:07

                12   low Earth orbit.  The Orion moves over and       13:47:12

                13   joins the stack.  It's injected to lunar         13:47:20

                14   orbit.  The lander goes down to the lunar        13:47:20

                15   surface after some amount of time.  The          13:47:28

                16   ascent module, if it's a crewed flight, comes    13:47:28

                17   back up to low lunar orbit, and the Orion        13:47:28

                18   capsule returns to a water -- a nominal water    13:47:35

                19   landing.  In the cargo mode you just take off    13:47:35

                20   the Orion and the ascent module.                 13:47:42

                21           So this is a view of how -- in           13:47:42

                22   reference years, just starting from one so       13:47:48

                23   that we're allowed to slide it back and forth    13:47:48

                24   on the schedule, how this would evolve; that     13:47:55

                25   in the first year you'd have human lunar         13:47:55





                                                                36



                 1   return, a single flight, for about seven days    13:48:01

                 2   on the lunar surface for up to four crew; by     13:48:01

                 3   the second year you'd have flights of up to      13:48:14

                 4   14 days with some initial power and              13:48:14

                 5   habitation and mobility; by about the third      13:48:14

                 6   year longer distance pressurized rovers would    13:48:14

                 7   be on the lunar surface providing                13:48:24

                 8   14-or-so-day traverses on the lunar surface;     13:48:24

                 9   and eventually, by about year six or so,         13:48:24

                10   you've established the capability of nearly      13:48:34

                11   continuous or continuous human presence and      13:48:34

                12   then you continue to build up capabilities       13:48:34

                13   from that.                                       13:48:43

                14           There are mixed in here the option of    13:48:43

                15   making short duration, order of seven-day        13:48:43

                16   sorties to other sites on the Moon of            13:48:43

                17   interest.                                        13:48:48

                18           So another strategy for exploring the    13:48:48

                19   Moon we call Lunar Global, and this allows       13:48:55

                20   the evolution of the lunar surface               13:49:01

                21   exploration to proceed more in a long sortie     13:49:01

                22   or brief habitation mode; that we start out      13:49:06

                23   by some number of sorties of up to 7 to          13:49:10

                24   14 days to various sites on the Moon which       13:49:13

                25   are of important scientific interest and then    13:49:17





                                                                37



                 1   we, in subsequent sorties, build up more and     13:49:23

                 2   more capability that's deployed to the Moon      13:49:30

                 3   of habitats and rovers.  This has the            13:49:33

                 4   advantage that you then have this several        13:49:35

                 5   hundred kilometer survey distance from a         13:49:38

                 6   number of sites on the Moon so that you don't    13:49:44

                 7   just go once to the pole and then are able to    13:49:48

                 8   explore on the surface from there, and it has    13:49:51

                 9   the disadvantage of not as effectively           13:49:53

                10   utilizing the assets that you've brought to      13:49:56

                11   the surface of the Moon on return visits.        13:49:59

                12           And there are some hybrids that go       13:50:01

                13   between the lunar global scenario and the        13:50:05

                14   base scenario, but these sort of represent       13:50:09

                15   the bookends in the system.  So in the           13:50:09

                16   sorties phase, there might be three or four      13:50:12

                17   sorties to a like number of locations about      13:50:17

                18   seven days.  In the extended duration, you       13:50:17

                19   went to a first site, you might stay 50,         13:50:20

                20   60 days -- I'm sorry -- I'm on Chart 19 --       13:50:20

                21   thank you -- that you would have -- come         13:50:29

                22   along with the cargo in some number of crewed    13:50:31

                23   flights, probably about five.  Then at the       13:50:36

                24   next site, you'd push it up to maybe as much     13:50:36

                25   as 90 days with several -- a couple of cargo     13:50:38





                                                                38



                 1   flights and maybe as many as six crew flights    13:50:41

                 2   and pressurized mobility and so on; that you     13:50:45

                 3   would, as you went to the next site, deploy      13:50:48

                 4   increasingly more capability.  And at some       13:50:50

                 5   point this strategy for exploring the lunar      13:50:53

                 6   surface might just go back to the first one.     13:50:55

                 7   At some point you've found a place which is      13:51:01

                 8   so interesting that you decide to build an       13:51:02

                 9   almost permanent crewed base at that site.       13:51:06

                10           So these are not completely different    13:51:10

                11   strategies.  They're slightly different          13:51:13

                12   strategies.                                      13:51:15

                13           So this would be what the timeline       13:51:17

                14   would look like for this Lunar Global; that      13:51:21

                15   there would be test flights and some sortie      13:51:23

                16   flights, maybe as many as five; then you'd       13:51:28

                17   go to the first extended duration location in    13:51:35

                18   Years 4 and 5 with some habitation; you'd go     13:51:35

                19   to the second -- and unpressurized rovers        13:51:35

                20   much like we used on Apollo -- the latter        13:51:40

                21   Apollo flights; you'd go to the second           13:51:46

                22   location with some more habitation and           13:51:46

                23   pressurized rovers for traverses and so on,      13:51:46

                24   building up capabilities.                        13:51:52

                25           We're also still carrying the option     13:51:52





                                                                39



                 1   of going first to the Moon -- I'm sorry --       13:51:58

                 2   first to Mars.  We have stated, for the          13:51:58

                 3   record, that we feel that the ultimate goal      13:52:06

                 4   of human exploration is to become a              13:52:06

                 5   space-faring civilization, that the likely       13:52:11

                 6   intermediate destination of that is on Mars      13:52:17

                 7   and that, therefore, we're carrying an option    13:52:17

                 8   of going essentially directly to Mars or Mars    13:52:22

                 9   First with the possibility that along the way    13:52:28

                10   there would be a test flight to the Moon of      13:52:28

                11   the Martian system or perhaps a visit to the     13:52:35

                12   NEOs of the Martian system.                      13:52:35

                13           Mars -- this is the next chart, 22.      13:52:40

                14   This doesn't have a number.  Right.              13:52:44

                15           The architecture to launch a piloted     13:52:44

                16   mission to Mars is substantially more            13:52:50

                17   challenging.  It involves as many as six         13:52:53

                18   Ares V flights to launch the cargo -- the two    13:52:56

                19   cargo flights, one of which brings an ascent     13:52:59

                20   vehicle from the Mars surface and one of         13:53:09

                21   which brings a Mars surface hab.  Then when      13:53:09

                22   that's all in place, as many as about three      13:53:13

                23   Ares V flights and one Ares I crew launch        13:53:13

                24   bring the piloted vehicle which goes to Mars,    13:53:18

                25   loiters in orbit while the crew goes down to     13:53:23





                                                                40



                 1   the surface for over 500 days and then           13:53:27

                 2   returns.                                         13:53:31

                 3           We've created a variant of this on       13:53:31

                 4   the next chart, which is what a dress            13:53:31

                 5   rehearsal for this would look like on the        13:53:37

                 6   lunar surface, and convinced ourselves that      13:53:42

                 7   if you were, in fact, to go directly to Mars     13:53:42

                 8   or Mars First that such a flight would be a      13:53:47

                 9   reasonable idea, but it would be a test          13:53:47

                10   flight.  It wouldn't have as its objectives      13:53:52

                11   explicitly to put humans on the Moon or to       13:53:56

                12   explore the Moon.  Its objectives would be to    13:53:56

                13   validate in an off-Earth environment the         13:54:00

                14   systems that would be used to go to Mars.        13:54:05

                15           And the timeline of this is              13:54:05

                16   significantly more extended.  Because of the     13:54:13

                17   timing of answering both technical questions,    13:54:13

                18   such as what is the right aerodynamic shape      13:54:19

                19   to use in a Mars entry, descent and landing      13:54:24

                20   system or a Mars aerobraking system -- you       13:54:30

                21   see that in there in the middle below the        13:54:34

                22   line around Year 7 and 8.  There would be        13:54:34

                23   more robotic landings, including likely a        13:54:37

                24   robotic sample return mission to assure          13:54:42

                25   forward -- to deal with issues with forward      13:54:46





                                                                41



                 1   and reverse contamination from the Martian       13:54:46

                 2   surface, and it would lead to the first          13:54:51

                 3   humans on Mars well into the second decade of    13:54:54

                 4   such a program.                                  13:54:58

                 5           The last of the destination              13:55:00

                 6   options -- Chart 25 -- is the one we call        13:55:02

                 7   Flexible Path.  Here essentially the strategy    13:55:06

                 8   is to extend human presence beyond LEO by        13:55:10

                 9   visiting locations within the near Earth         13:55:15

                10   space up to and including flybys and orbits      13:55:17

                11   of Mars but not immediately go to the            13:55:23

                12   planetary surface.  Now, it turns out that       13:55:27

                13   there are both programmatic and technical        13:55:31

                14   reasons to do this.                              13:55:35

                15           The programmatic reason is that the      13:55:35

                16   steps necessary to get to the planetary          13:55:43

                17   surface, to build the modern-day LM, to          13:55:43

                18   build the modern-day rover, to build the         13:55:43

                19   habitation and power systems, in fact,           13:55:49

                20   produce significant budgetary wedges in the      13:55:49

                21   program.                                         13:55:49

                22           So, in essence, what this plan is --     13:55:53

                23   is one where we develop experience operating     13:55:53

                24   beyond LEO by visiting some interesting          13:56:01

                25   places and some near Earth objects and doing     13:56:01





                                                                42



                 1   flybys up to and including flybys of Mars        13:56:01

                 2   while we are at the same time developing the     13:56:10

                 3   capability, within reasonable expectation of     13:56:10

                 4   budget, to explore planetary surfaces and        13:56:18

                 5   then go back and go and explore the lunar        13:56:18

                 6   surface.                                         13:56:24

                 7           So the in-space part of it would look    13:56:24

                 8   something like this, that there's first a        13:56:24

                 9   lunar flyby-like mission; there would be then    13:56:29

                10   missions of up to the twenties of days to the    13:56:29

                11   near Earth vicinity, the Lagrange points         13:56:33

                12   where the gravitational influence of Earth       13:56:37

                13   and Mars are balanced, which are potential       13:56:39

                14   sites for future exploration systems such as     13:56:43

                15   fuel depots and are potential sites for          13:56:43

                16   future servicing missions of scientific          13:56:47

                17   spacecraft that might be brought to those        13:56:52

                18   points for servicing.                            13:56:54

                19           Then there would be to go to the         13:56:56

                20   Earth-Sun tipping points, the libration          13:56:58

                21   points, for example, the L2 point in the         13:57:00

                22   shadow of the Earth from the Sun, which is a     13:57:02

                23   likely location for many future astronomical     13:57:05

                24   observatories, or the L1 point between the       13:57:09

                25   Earth and the Sun, which would be the first      13:57:11





                                                                43



                 1   time that humans would travel not only           13:57:13

                 2   outside of the magnetosphere of the Earth but    13:57:15

                 3   outside of the bow shock wave of the Earth       13:57:18

                 4   and solar wind and, therefore, better            13:57:21

                 5   characterize and understand the physiological    13:57:24

                 6   effects on humans of a true deep space           13:57:27

                 7   environment that would be necessary for          13:57:32

                 8   transit to Mars.                                 13:57:32

                 9           By that time you would build the         13:57:32

                10   capability to do a Mars flyby and potentially    13:57:37

                11   an inner solar system orbital flight like a      13:57:37

                12   rendezvous with Mars' Phobos and -- Mars'        13:57:37

                13   moons Phobos and Deimos.                         13:57:41

                14           MR. McALISTER:  Ed, just a               13:57:47

                15   clarification, don't we subsequently call        13:57:47

                16   this Deep Space?                                 13:57:48

                17           DR. CRAWLEY:  We do.                     13:57:49

                18           MR. McALISTER:  Okay.                    13:57:49

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  We have unfortunately      13:57:49

                20   used both Deep Space and Flexible Path to        13:57:50

                21   characterize the name of this.  Good point.      13:57:54

                22           Chart 27 this is the equivalent flow     13:57:58

                23   diagram of this mission.  Mission option,        13:58:03

                24   that there would be unpiloted lunar flights      13:58:04

                25   and piloted lunar flights and then some          13:58:08





                                                                44



                 1   flights of increasing days up to 90 days.        13:58:09

                 2   90 days is approximately ten times longer        13:58:15

                 3   than any humans have ever been outside of the    13:58:17

                 4   low Earth orbit.  So this is not an              13:58:19

                 5   insignificant accomplishment.                    13:58:21

                 6           Then a flight of maybe 180 days to       13:58:24

                 7   one or several near Earth objects.  These are    13:58:29

                 8   the objects which are on crossing paths with     13:58:32

                 9   Earth that have both scientific and planetary    13:58:37

                10   protection implications, that understanding      13:58:41

                11   their trajectories and their composition         13:58:41

                12   could be important for several reasons.          13:58:44

                13           And then we've basically shown on        13:58:44

                14   this diagram a branch off onto human lunar       13:58:46

                15   return by about Year 7 or 8 into the             13:58:51

                16   program -- 7 or 8 from the beginning of the      13:58:54

                17   piloted test flights.                            13:58:54

                18           So what I just took you through          13:58:58

                19   was -- now on Chart 28.  What I just took you    13:58:59

                20   through were five key decisions -- what we do    13:59:04

                21   with the shuttle, what we do with the            13:59:06

                22   station, what the U.S. heavy-launch              13:59:09

                23   capability should be, what the U.S. strategy     13:59:12

                24   for getting to low Earth orbit with crew         13:59:19

                25   should be and where we should go beyond low      13:59:19





                                                                45



                 1   Earth orbit.  And for each of those five         13:59:26

                 2   decisions, I described several choices that a    13:59:26

                 3   policymaker would have, some of them as few      13:59:31

                 4   as two choices and some of them as many as       13:59:31

                 5   four.                                            13:59:38

                 6           What we did, both leading up to the      13:59:38

                 7   last public meeting and subsequently, was we     13:59:38

                 8   tried to create what we call integrated          13:59:38

                 9   options.  These are ways to string together      13:59:45

                10   these choices of each of the individual          13:59:45

                11   choices -- the decisions about each of the       13:59:45

                12   individual choices in such a way that it         13:59:52

                13   produces a package that makes good sense and     13:59:52

                14   then to examine these integrated packages --     14:00:00

                15   these integrated options both from the           14:00:00

                16   technical perspective, which I will not say      14:00:00

                17   any more about, and from a cost and schedule     14:00:06

                18   perspective, as Dr. Ride will speak about        14:00:12

                19   next.                                            14:00:12

                20           So I'll just take you very quickly       14:00:12

                21   through the integrated options, and this the     14:00:17

                22   is the handoff to the budget and schedule        14:00:17

                23   discussion.                                      14:00:26

                24           The first one is -- and the              14:00:26

                25   highlighting in color on this chart is           14:00:26





                                                                46



                 1   intended to just sort of flag up what it is      14:00:26

                 2   that changes -- the principal change from one    14:00:34

                 3   row to the next.                                 14:00:34

                 4           So the first row is the program of       14:00:34

                 5   record, as I described it, not constrained to    14:00:34

                 6   the fiscal year '10 budget, shuttle retiring     14:00:34

                 7   in '11, station retiring in '15, launching       14:00:44

                 8   with the Ares I and Ares, crew on Ares I and     14:00:44

                 9   Orion, going to the Moon in a sortie and         14:00:57

                10   outpost.                                         14:00:57

                11           We then constrained that in an           14:00:57

                12   attempt to get a program that would fit          14:00:57

                13   within the President's budget -- to be           14:00:57

                14   constrained to the FY '10 budget.  That's the    14:00:57

                15   second integrated option.                        14:01:12

                16           The third integrated option is one       14:01:12

                17   which otherwise leaves the program of record     14:01:12

                18   largely unchanged and only extends the space     14:01:12

                19   station date to 2020.  We examined that with     14:01:12

                20   Ares as the commercial -- as the launch --       14:01:26

                21   Ares I as the launch mechanism to low Earth      14:01:26

                22   orbit and with the commercial launch to low      14:01:26

                23   Earth orbit.                                     14:01:26

                24           And then we had one other variant        14:01:26

                25   which goes to the Moon but is -- and extends     14:01:41





                                                                47



                 1   the shuttle life and bases government launch     14:01:41

                 2   services on the shuttle-derived vehicle.         14:01:41

                 3           So these are, you can see, different     14:01:41

                 4   combinations of ways in which you would          14:02:00

                 5   eventually get to something like a lunar         14:02:00

                 6   outpost but by considering different             14:02:00

                 7   combinations of shuttle extension, station       14:02:00

                 8   extension and some modest changes in the         14:02:00

                 9   launch vehicle.                                  14:02:00

                10           The second set are the ones that         14:02:11

                11   basically go into the Flexible Path or           14:02:11

                12   Deep Space option, so that the common thing      14:02:11

                13   here on the right-hand side is the               14:02:11

                14   destinations and the strategy for                14:02:11

                15   exploration -- going to lunar orbit, the         14:02:25

                16   Lagrange points, the NEOs, a Mars flyby and      14:02:25

                17   then to the Moon.                                14:02:25

                18           So the first one is what we call Dash    14:02:25

                19   Out of LEO, it's constrained to the budget,      14:02:25

                20   if shuttle retires in '11, the station in        14:02:37

                21   '15, we go directly to the Ares Lite,            14:02:37

                22   bypassing the Ares I, and use commercial crew    14:02:37

                23   capability -- commercial delivery of crew to     14:02:54

                24   LEO.                                             14:02:54

                25           The one we call Deep Space option is     14:02:54





                                                                48



                 1   not constrained, extends the ISS and uses the    14:02:54

                 2   Ares V Lite.                                     14:02:54

                 3           The one that we call Deep Space EELV     14:02:54

                 4   relies on building a commercial hydrocarbon      14:03:15

                 5   75-ish-ton LEO class vehicle.                    14:03:15

                 6           And the last one does much the same      14:03:15

                 7   thing except swapping out the shuttle-derived    14:03:15

                 8   vehicle.                                         14:03:15

                 9           So as you can see here, these are        14:03:15

                10   principally changing in and out the launch --    14:03:15

                11   the heavy-launch vehicle is the thing that's     14:03:36

                12   principally changing here.                       14:03:36

                13           And the last three are arguably the      14:03:36

                14   ones that are either slightly or completely      14:03:36

                15   focused on Mars, that is to say, that there's    14:03:36

                16   lunar sorties and extended stays which are       14:03:36

                17   intended to be in a more Mars-like               14:03:57

                18   exploration preparation strategy.  And, here     14:03:57

                19   again, the principal change is the swap-out      14:03:57

                20   of the commercial hydrocarbon vehicle with       14:03:57

                21   the Ares V Lite.                                 14:03:57

                22           And the last one is the Mars First       14:03:57

                23   strategy of not going to the Moon but            14:03:57

                24   planning on focusing and building systems to     14:03:57

                25   go exclusively to Mars but reserving the         14:04:15





                                                                49



                 1   possibility that we do a test flight on the      14:04:15

                 2   Moon.                                            14:04:15

                 3           So that summarizes the technical         14:04:15

                 4   considerations that have been underway and       14:04:15

                 5   the refinements that have been made.             14:04:15

                 6           And now I'll hand it off -- or, Norm,    14:04:15

                 7   do you want to have a discussion or --           14:04:15

                 8           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think what we will     14:04:34

                 9   do is ask you questions we have.  And with       14:04:34

                10   regard to the possibility of adding options      14:04:34

                11   or deleting options, which is something I        14:04:34

                12   hope we can consider seriously here, we'll do    14:04:34

                13   that after we've heard the cost part             14:04:34

                14   probably.  Before you leave, I've got some       14:04:57

                15   questions.                                       14:04:57

                16           Does anybody else have questions they    14:04:57

                17   want to raise?                                   14:04:57

                18           Okay.  Fine.  I saw you first, Jeff,     14:04:57

                19   and then Chris.                                  14:04:57

                20           MR. GREASON:  This is as much a          14:04:57

                21   comment as a question.  I am particular --       14:04:57

                22   because of the ties I have in the commercial     14:04:57

                23   world, I've been getting an awful lot of         14:04:57

                24   questions of people going why aren't we all      14:04:57

                25   excited about a lunar base because we want to    14:04:57





                                                                50



                 1   do in situ propellant production -- a            14:05:14

                 2   sentiment with which I'm in total agreement.     14:05:14

                 3   And you have to really dive down into the        14:05:14

                 4   details of what was envisioned for the lunar     14:05:14

                 5   base scenario to realize that, while we might    14:05:14

                 6   want a lunar base to do in situ propellant       14:05:30

                 7   production, it wasn't this lunar base.           14:05:30

                 8           This lunar base was proceeding in a      14:05:30

                 9   rapid fashion and very reminiscent of ISS to     14:05:30

                10   get the capability up there, maybe we'll do      14:05:30

                11   some science with it but we'll fundamentally     14:05:44

                12   think about what we're going to do with it       14:05:44

                13   and why it's there later.  And that's the        14:05:44

                14   reason why -- it's, in fact, my advocacy of      14:05:44

                15   wanting to do industrial development on the      14:05:44

                16   Moon that has pushed me very strongly in the     14:05:44

                17   direction of the Lunar Global scenario,          14:05:44

                18   because that way we do exploration and we        14:06:01

                19   build up a transportation infrastructure that    14:06:01

                20   we can do lots of things with while we find      14:06:01

                21   out what's up there and figure out what the      14:06:01

                22   things are that we want to do.                   14:06:01

                23           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Good comment.            14:06:01

                24           Chris...                                 14:06:01

                25           DR. CHYBA:  Ed, I just wanted to note    14:06:01





                                                                51



                 1   that some of your Flexible Path slides           14:06:01

                 2   show -- as was the case the last time we saw     14:06:21

                 3   these in, I think, Cocoa Beach -- show Venus     14:06:21

                 4   as a possible destination along the Flexible     14:06:21

                 5   Path, and I wanted to note that, from my         14:06:21

                 6   point of view, I think that Venus makes very     14:06:21

                 7   little sense as a destination for human          14:06:21

                 8   missions and would be a terrible distraction     14:06:21

                 9   from those destinations that do make sense,      14:06:21

                10   mainly Mars and with -- and Moon.  So I would    14:06:38

                11   recommend that Venus simply be dropped from      14:06:38

                12   all of the Deep Space and Flexible Path          14:06:38

                13   scenarios.                                       14:06:38

                14           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Does anybody have a      14:06:38

                15   problem with that?                               14:06:54

                16           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  I agree with that.     14:06:54

                17           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think it's probably    14:06:54

                18   a good idea too.                                 14:06:54

                19           DR. AUSTIN:  Norm, I had a question.     14:06:54

                20           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  Please,           14:06:54

                21   Wanda...                                         14:06:54

                22           DR. AUSTIN:  Ed, in your Chinese menu    14:06:54

                23   of, you know, a little shuttle, a little         14:06:54

                24   station, a little exploration, you didn't        14:06:54

                25   explicitly talk about technology except for      14:06:54





                                                                52



                 1   the propellant options.  I think that one of     14:07:02

                 2   the things that, you know, I'm concerned         14:07:02

                 3   about is in order to do some of these hard       14:07:02

                 4   things does require an investment in tech        14:07:11

                 5   development and maturation with an eye toward    14:07:11

                 6   the actual application.                          14:07:16

                 7           So I guess my question to you for        14:07:16

                 8   clarification is:  What are your assumptions     14:07:22

                 9   about a tech investment that's associated        14:07:22

                10   with each of these options?                      14:07:22

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  Thank you for      14:07:29

                12   flagging that up.                                14:07:29

                13           At Cocoa Beach, I think it was, Jeff     14:07:29

                14   made a presentation as part of our working       14:07:29

                15   group on the high priority items which are --    14:07:37

                16   many of which are, in fact, enabling of some     14:07:37

                17   of these routes -- the large high thrust         14:07:42

                18   LOX/kerosene engine, the fuel transfer, some     14:07:48

                19   of the technology of planetary encounter --      14:07:48

                20   I'm trying to think what else were the main      14:07:52

                21   items on the list --                             14:07:52

                22           MR. GREASON:  Advanced space             14:07:55

                23   propulsion of one kind or another.               14:07:55

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- advanced in-space       14:07:55

                25   propulsion, restartable long cold soak,          14:07:58





                                                                53



                 1   restartable engines, which are not of            14:07:59

                 2   interest to really anybody but NASA -- that      14:08:02

                 3   is to say, it's not a pertinent problem on       14:08:05

                 4   launch off of the Earth -- and a similar list    14:08:08

                 5   of things that was in our Cocoa Beach            14:08:13

                 6   presentation.                                    14:08:16

                 7           And you're absolutely right.  There      14:08:16

                 8   have to be three things that are consistent      14:08:19

                 9   here.  One is the dedication of NASA and the     14:08:21

                10   highly trained and expert workforce of NASA      14:08:25

                11   to work on these problems, the second is         14:08:28

                12   their linkage to the future plans for            14:08:30

                13   exploration and the third is their linkage to    14:08:33

                14   the budget.                                      14:08:37

                15           And we have recommended, as you'll       14:08:37

                16   see in Sally's presentation, which has been      14:08:40

                17   adopted in, I think, all but the program of      14:08:45

                18   record reference case, what we would consider    14:08:45

                19   a fairly robust technology investment program    14:08:50

                20   that would not only directly serve the needs     14:08:53

                21   of Constellation but the longer term needs       14:08:55

                22   of -- not only the near-term needs of            14:08:58

                23   Constellation but the longer term needs of       14:09:02

                24   exploration and also the needs of a              14:09:05

                25   burgeoning commercial space community,           14:09:10





                                                                54



                 1   needless to say, in addition, from a             14:09:10

                 2   perspective that you would say consistent        14:09:13

                 3   with the Space Act of 1958, the development      14:09:15

                 4   of technologies which are also of interest to    14:09:18

                 5   the security interests of the nation.            14:09:20

                 6           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Other questions?         14:09:23

                 7           MR. BEJMUK:  I have one more             14:09:25

                 8   question.                                        14:09:27

                 9           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Sure, Bo.                14:09:27

                10           MR. BEJMUK:  You know, when I look at    14:09:31

                11   these options, Ed, we have these options of a    14:09:31

                12   different selection of the launch system that    14:09:36

                13   will support these integrated options, and       14:09:39

                14   when I, for example, look at Ares V Lite         14:09:41

                15   versus, for example, shuttle derived or the      14:09:45

                16   hydrocarbon rocket, what this doesn't really     14:09:50

                17   reflect is the additional mission complexity     14:09:53

                18   that you have to face when you use more than     14:09:56

                19   one or more than two rockets.                    14:09:59

                20           And, you know, if we just observe        14:10:03

                21   how -- what it takes to launch shuttle or any    14:10:05

                22   of the other launch vehicles, you get            14:10:09

                23   affected by winds on the ground, winds aloft,    14:10:12

                24   lightning, load glitches in a ECO sensor and     14:10:16

                25   God knows what else.  So the more rockets you    14:10:19





                                                                55



                 1   have to launch, the more difficult it is to      14:10:21

                 2   execute a mission.                               14:10:24

                 3           And I'd like to hear your opinion        14:10:24

                 4   of -- what do you think; what is an element      14:10:28

                 5   of increasing of mission complexity when it      14:10:28

                 6   goes to more smaller rockets, and would you      14:10:35

                 7   agree with me that for a big trip you need to    14:10:35

                 8   have fewer big rockets?                          14:10:40

                 9           You know, when I saw your picture        14:10:40

                10   going to Mars and I saw half a dozen of          14:10:45

                11   Ares V, you probably couldn't put --             14:10:45

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  Probably closer to a       14:10:45

                13   dozen of Ares V actually.                        14:10:45

                14           MR. BEJMUK:  -- you probably couldn't    14:10:47

                15   put enough smaller rockets on this page and      14:10:47

                16   not to mention how you would manage this         14:10:51

                17   scenario, you know, when you have to watch       14:10:55

                18   weather, watch all of the other restrictions,    14:10:57

                19   watch hardware integrity to be able to           14:11:03

                20   execute these very many multiple missions.       14:11:06

                21           So could you address that mission        14:11:09

                22   complexity resulting from a large number of      14:11:11

                23   smaller launch vehicles?                         14:11:15

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  I'll be happy to, and      14:11:15

                25   then I'll invite comment from anyone else on     14:11:16





                                                                56



                 1   the panel.                                       14:11:18

                 2           But you are right.  If one moves to a    14:11:21

                 3   smaller launch vehicle, one has to               14:11:24

                 4   consistently make one or two -- one of two --    14:11:24

                 5   go down one of two routes.  You either have      14:11:28

                 6   to downsize the size of the in-space systems     14:11:36

                 7   that you're going to use or keep the same        14:11:36

                 8   size in-space systems and develop a very         14:11:43

                 9   capable in-space refueling, which introduces     14:11:54

                10   a certain type of in-space complexity not        14:11:54

                11   in -- we do not think impossible but not         14:11:54

                12   likely to be easy, or you have to go down the    14:11:54

                13   route of having more launches from the Earth     14:12:09

                14   of the -- call them slightly smaller             14:12:09

                15   heavy-lift launch vehicles, which causes the     14:12:09

                16   complications of additional pad availability,    14:12:09

                17   range availability, weather issues and so        14:12:22

                18   forth.                                           14:12:22

                19           And we actually had, in the course of    14:12:22

                20   the last couple weeks, NASA do an analysis       14:12:22

                21   for us of basically launch availability when     14:12:22

                22   some number of critical payloads -- some         14:12:36

                23   number of critical launches and some number      14:12:36

                24   of less critical launches had to be flown        14:12:36

                25   within a certain window of time.                 14:12:36





                                                                57



                 1           And as exactly you expect, as anyone     14:12:36

                 2   who's ever watched the shuttle try and fly,      14:12:46

                 3   the more launches of vehicles that you need      14:12:46

                 4   to get within a window, the more that impacts    14:12:46

                 5   the total mission availability, without going    14:12:52

                 6   into the details of what the trades are.         14:12:52

                 7           But one of the things that we did        14:13:01

                 8   notice in this is that we will rediscover        14:13:01

                 9   soon something that spacefarers knew in the      14:13:01

                10   '60s -- is that if you abort in the ocean,       14:13:09

                11   there's an additional factor of sea state        14:13:13

                12   that comes into play as well, which -- and       14:13:17

                13   it's been a long time since we've thought        14:13:21

                14   about sea state on a -- that is to say, how      14:13:24

                15   stormy it is in the ocean.  It's been a long     14:13:26

                16   time since we've thought about that, but it      14:13:26

                17   won't be long before we start thinking about     14:13:28

                18   it again.  And that, too, plays into the         14:13:30

                19   consideration of the human element of the        14:13:33

                20   launch, regardless of how the launch goes.       14:13:35

                21           So you're right.  You either have to     14:13:39

                22   sort of downsize the upper -- the things that    14:13:39

                23   you throw away from the Earth or you have to     14:13:45

                24   invest in the refueling technology or you get    14:13:45

                25   more launches or some combination of those       14:13:52





                                                                58



                 1   things.                                          14:13:52

                 2           MR. BEJMUK:  Thank you.                  14:13:52

                 3           MR. GREASON:  Yes.  I'd to take your     14:13:52

                 4   invitation to comment further.                   14:13:58

                 5           Ultimately we want to be able to do      14:13:58

                 6   bigger and better things in space.  And I        14:14:01

                 7   don't think anybody thinks that we're going      14:14:08

                 8   to go to Mars some day with one really big       14:14:09

                 9   rocket.  So you ultimately -- it's not a         14:14:13

                10   question of what you need to learn to do.        14:14:17

                11   It's ultimately a question of what order you     14:14:21

                12   need to learn to do it in.  Either we learn      14:14:27

                13   how to put more things together, which lends     14:14:33

                14   itself to less large -- I won't call them        14:14:33

                15   small -- rockets, and that involves both an      14:14:37

                16   investment in technology and that involves an    14:14:42

                17   investment in learning the things you need to    14:14:42

                18   learn to support a higher flight rate.  And      14:14:47

                19   there's many of them.                            14:14:47

                20           And, again, as you say, when you look    14:14:53

                21   at the Mars infrastructure, it's not as          14:14:53

                22   though we're not going to launch six or seven    14:15:00

                23   or eight launches per mission on the current     14:15:00

                24   plans.  The difference is cost is an             14:15:00

                25   independent variable.  And, you know, it is      14:15:11





                                                                59



                 1   not obvious that all of the ways of doing        14:15:11

                 2   this also cost the same.  It's also not          14:15:11

                 3   obvious that we're ever going to go to           14:15:20

                 4   Mars -- actually it is obvious to me that        14:15:20

                 5   we're not going to go to Mars with the           14:15:28

                 6   current technology suite.  So we don't know      14:15:28

                 7   how many pieces of what size we're going to      14:15:28

                 8   need to go to Mars.                              14:15:37

                 9           So it's just -- I just don't think       14:15:37

                10   it's true to say that we know, as you            14:15:37

                11   stipulated, that you have to have a really       14:15:37

                12   big rocket to go places.  I think that's one     14:15:37

                13   of the options.  But it is not obvious that      14:15:49

                14   it's the best option, and it's certainly not     14:15:49

                15   true that it's the only option.                  14:15:49

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Sally...                 14:15:49

                17           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  I wanted to just       14:16:06

                18   pick up on something that Ed mentioned.  You     14:16:06

                19   know, Ed brought up that we'll be landing in     14:16:06

                20   the water again with the present plan for        14:16:06

                21   Orion, and that opens up to me the whole         14:16:06

                22   issue of operations costs.                       14:16:06

                23           We haven't really had a robust           14:16:23

                24   discussion about the size of Orion.  It's the    14:16:23

                25   size of Orion with the five-meter capsule        14:16:23





                                                                60



                 1   that actually drives you to the need for a       14:16:23

                 2   water landing.  Were the capsule a smaller       14:16:38

                 3   capsule, you'd at least have the opportunity     14:16:38

                 4   of considering a land landing.  I know both      14:16:38

                 5   Leroy and I would prefer to land on land if      14:16:38

                 6   we got to choose.                                14:16:53

                 7           But I think that maybe more to the       14:16:53

                 8   point is that a water landing probably           14:16:53

                 9   significantly increases the operations costs     14:16:53

                10   that you'll be facing with the vehicle for       14:16:53

                11   years and years and years and years into the     14:16:53

                12   future, and that's just one small example of     14:16:53

                13   our collective tendency to optimize programs     14:17:11

                14   for the DDT&E cost, the DDT&E phase, but         14:17:11

                15   neglect or push off until the future             14:17:11

                16   discussion of the operations costs and trying    14:17:11

                17   to optimize for the ops phase that's gotten      14:17:11

                18   us into trouble before on the shuttle            14:17:24

                19   program, on the station program, where the       14:17:24

                20   ops costs just became what they became once      14:17:24

                21   we were able to launch the shuttle and once      14:17:36

                22   we were able to begin operating the station.     14:17:36

                23           And it would appear that we're in        14:17:36

                24   danger of heading down the same path with the    14:17:36

                25   current program or any program that we might     14:17:47





                                                                61



                 1   elect to evolve into, and I think that I         14:17:47

                 2   would argue that we should put a lot more        14:17:47

                 3   thought -- NASA going forward -- put a lot       14:17:53

                 4   more thought into the operational costs of       14:17:57

                 5   whatever suite of vehicles and elements we go    14:18:02

                 6   forward with, because it's those operations      14:18:02

                 7   costs that, once you're finished with the        14:18:05

                 8   development, you're stuck with for 10 years,     14:18:08

                 9   20 years, 30 years, 40 years and, especially     14:18:10

                10   an exploration program, you're going to be       14:18:17

                11   facing those costs for a very long time in       14:18:17

                12   the future.  So it really pays to consider       14:18:24

                13   them in the development phase of the program.    14:18:24

                14           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you, Sally.        14:18:29

                15           Ed, I've got three items I'd like to     14:18:29

                16   raise, and then we'll, I think, move ahead       14:18:36

                17   into costing.                                    14:18:36

                18           The first is a nit, and that is, the     14:18:40

                19   program of record, we need to fix the chart      14:18:40

                20   to show it's 2010 on the shuttle here.           14:18:48

                21           The second is that the integrated        14:18:48

                22   options, the first two of them, really           14:18:55

                23   ultimately enable a trip to Mars, I think,       14:18:55

                24   and the document here makes it sound like        14:19:05

                25   they're sort of dead-ended after the flybys      14:19:05





                                                                62



                 1   and so on.  If I'm right, we ought to do         14:19:09

                 2   something to make clear that there's another     14:19:14

                 3   phase beyond this.  It's just beyond our         14:19:21

                 4   costing and lifetimes, I'm afraid.               14:19:21

                 5           The third one is kind of a Catch 22      14:19:21

                 6   where, as you were describing the first block    14:19:32

                 7   of options, you had mentioned that if you had    14:19:32

                 8   a shuttle-derived vehicle it would make sense    14:19:32

                 9   to keep the shuttle operating, which makes       14:19:32

                10   some sense to me.  On the other hand, if you     14:19:44

                11   keep the shuttle operating, you won't have       14:19:44

                12   any money to build the shuttle-derived           14:19:44

                13   vehicle.  And would you care to comment.         14:19:44

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  I think that's an          14:19:57

                15   excellent introduction to Dr. Ride.              14:19:57

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.                    14:19:57

                17           DR. CRAWLEY:  And I was just going to    14:19:57

                18   ask, Sally, you know, it doesn't make a          14:19:57

                19   difference to you that it's off San Diego?       14:19:57

                20           DR. RIDE:  Well, actually as a matter    14:19:57

                21   of fact, it does make a difference to me that    14:20:08

                22   it's just off San Diego.  So I'm hoping for      14:20:08

                23   precision in the landings.                       14:20:08

                24           Norm, let me just, before I get up,      14:20:08

                25   briefly address that question because we're      14:20:20





                                                                63



                 1   about to get buried in numbers, and I think      14:20:20

                 2   that that's a good question to discuss.          14:20:20

                 3           As you'll see in -- as part of           14:20:33

                 4   this -- or as, I'm sure, will come out in the    14:20:33

                 5   discussion, the cost of NASA's existing          14:20:33

                 6   infrastructure, facilities, workforce,           14:20:33

                 7   capabilities are a real important                14:20:33

                 8   consideration actually in all of these           14:20:47

                 9   scenarios.  Because in some cases, you're        14:20:47

                10   able to keep them.  In some cases, you keep      14:20:47

                11   them to a significant extent, but you have to    14:20:47

                12   reconstitute the workforce.                      14:21:00

                13           When shuttle retires, there will be a    14:21:00

                14   significant disruption to the workforce.         14:21:00

                15   Other of our options require less of the NASA    14:21:00

                16   infrastructure.  And there's one, in             14:21:11

                17   particular, that actually envisions a            14:21:11

                18   completely different model that would bring      14:21:11

                19   with it significant disruptions to the           14:21:11

                20   NASA -- the existing infrastructure.  So         14:21:23

                21   we're going to see that play out.                14:21:23

                22           The combination of the shuttle and a     14:21:23

                23   shuttle-derived vehicle takes maximum            14:21:23

                24   advantage of the existing facilities, the        14:21:36

                25   existing infrastructure, the existing            14:21:36





                                                                64



                 1   workforce, the existing elements.  So in some    14:21:36

                 2   sense, those costs are shared by the shuttle     14:21:36

                 3   and the shuttle-derived vehicle.  So there is    14:21:47

                 4   some savings.  That's not to say that it's       14:21:47

                 5   necessarily the most cost-effective program,     14:21:47

                 6   but there are savings that way.  And, in         14:22:00

                 7   fact, there are actually some savings just       14:22:00

                 8   going directly to a shuttle-derived vehicle,     14:22:00

                 9   again, because it's got the most commonality     14:22:00

                10   with the existing infrastructure and             14:22:00

                11   facilities.  But we're going to see this play    14:22:13

                12   out in the costing.                              14:22:13

                13           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Thank you.               14:22:13

                14           MR. GREASON:  While Sally gets up,       14:22:28

                15   one more on this point.  I don't believe we      14:22:28

                16   said that if you're going to do the              14:22:28

                17   shuttle-derived vehicle you might as well        14:22:28

                18   extend the shuttle.                              14:22:28

                19           DR. RIDE:  That's exactly right.         14:22:28

                20           MR. GREASON:  It's the other way         14:22:28

                21   around.  If you were going to extend the         14:22:28

                22   shuttle, then the only heavy lift option that    14:22:28

                23   makes sense is the shuttle-derived vehicle.      14:22:28

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, it seems to me     14:22:43

                25   there's a case for the other as well in the      14:22:43





                                                                65



                 1   sense that for continuity of workforce and       14:22:43

                 2   facilities -- it's a stronger case than the      14:22:43

                 3   rest of you made it, but it seems to me          14:22:43

                 4   there's a case.                                  14:22:56

                 5           DR. CHYBA:  It might also make sense     14:22:56

                 6   to have a shuttle-derived vehicle and not        14:22:56

                 7   extend shuttle.  I mean, I think all of those    14:22:56

                 8   are in the space right now.                      14:22:56

                 9           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.                    14:22:56

                10           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  Exactly.               14:22:56

                11           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  Sally...          14:22:56

                12           DR. RIDE:  Okay.  Could I have the       14:22:56

                13   first slide.                                     14:22:56

                14           I think it's fair to say that our        14:23:11

                15   review group drew the short straw and I drew     14:23:11

                16   the shortest by having to actually give this     14:23:11

                17   presentation.  But the first thing that I        14:23:11

                18   want to do is implicate my coconspirators        14:23:11

                19   here.  So the team that has actually spent an    14:23:11

                20   enormous amount of time over the last five or    14:23:25

                21   six days is myself, Professor Crawley, Jeff      14:23:25

                22   Greason and Bo.                                  14:23:25

                23           We've been working very, very closely    14:23:33

                24   with the team from Aerospace Corporation,        14:23:33

                25   which was leading the costing exercise.          14:23:33





                                                                66



                 1   They're our an independent -- independent        14:23:42

                 2   assessment arm, and they're here just to make    14:23:42

                 3   sure that we've got a nice arm's length from     14:23:49

                 4   NASA.                                            14:23:49

                 5           Having said that, I think we all         14:23:49

                 6   recognized -- Aerospace certainly recognized     14:23:56

                 7   and we recognized that without close             14:23:56

                 8   collaboration with NASA the data that they       14:23:56

                 9   were putting into the costing models would       14:24:02

                10   immediately be suspect.  So we formed a not      14:24:02

                11   small team -- a large team from Aerospace and    14:24:07

                12   an even larger and geographically widely         14:24:15

                13   dispersed group from NASA that have spent a      14:24:15

                14   lot of good quality time getting to know each    14:24:19

                15   other over the last few days.                    14:24:26

                16           And what I'm going to explain is a       14:24:26

                17   little bit of a work in process, as you'll       14:24:31

                18   see, but the first thing that I need to do is    14:24:31

                19   thank everybody, particularly the people from    14:24:38

                20   Aerospace and the people from NASA, who have     14:24:38

                21   been putting in the extraordinarily long         14:24:38

                22   hours over the last five days.  And it's         14:24:48

                23   literally been -- I mean, literally 24/7         14:24:48

                24   since last Wednesday late afternoon.  Next       14:24:48

                25   slide.                                           14:24:55





                                                                67



                 1           So let me go through our timeline and    14:24:55

                 2   process just to give you a sense of what         14:24:59

                 3   we've been going through here.  Ed briefed       14:24:59

                 4   the seven scenarios -- which we've expanded      14:25:07

                 5   somewhat, but he re-briefed again just now --    14:25:10

                 6   on last Wednesday, about 160 hours ago.  So      14:25:12

                 7   this is not -- has not got a long shelf life     14:25:15

                 8   here.                                            14:25:20

                 9           The committee members finalized most     14:25:20

                10   of the ground rules and the assumptions that     14:25:23

                11   would go into this costing exercise through a    14:25:25

                12   series of long discussions on Thursday night     14:25:28

                13   and culminating in discussions late Friday       14:25:36

                14   and then from last Thursday through -- I've      14:25:36

                15   got on the chart -- a very late last night.      14:25:40

                16   It turns out I was optimistic in that chart.     14:25:45

                17   The last chart actually came in about an hour    14:25:47

                18   ago.  So this is late-breaking news.             14:25:50

                19           Aerospace ran a costing model for all    14:25:55

                20   of the scenarios and the derivatives that we     14:25:58

                21   identified, and these were based on a variety    14:26:01

                22   of different launch vehicles, as you've heard    14:26:03

                23   from Ed, and different assumed funding           14:26:09

                24   levels, as you'll see as we go forward here.     14:26:09

                25   We had a variety of different telecons and       14:26:12





                                                                68



                 1   other discussions, a lot of them three hours     14:26:17

                 2   or more, every day since Thursday between the    14:26:25

                 3   committee members, Aerospace and the NASA        14:26:25

                 4   team -- many tens of people on these             14:26:25

                 5   telecons -- to review the iterations of the      14:26:30

                 6   output and to validate the data that was         14:26:32

                 7   going into these models, resolve any issues,     14:26:35

                 8   and we had many robust debates between           14:26:40

                 9   committee members, between Aerospace and         14:26:44

                10   NASA, between any combination of people you      14:26:46

                11   can name in this group to get to where we are    14:26:48

                12   today.  Next slide.                              14:26:52

                13           So today's product is significantly      14:26:53

                14   better than when we started 160 hours ago,       14:26:57

                15   but as I said, it's a bit of a work in           14:27:00

                16   progress.  And I suspect that coming out of      14:27:03

                17   the day we'll actually be asked to refine        14:27:06

                18   certain areas of the analysis to try to get a    14:27:10

                19   little bit better handle on some scenario        14:27:13

                20   combinations that we might identify here.        14:27:17

                21   Next slide.                                      14:27:20

                22           Let me go through our key ground         14:27:22

                23   rules and assumptions, because these are         14:27:25

                24   important to understand as we go into looking    14:27:28

                25   at the actual costing scenarios.                 14:27:31





                                                                69



                 1           The first is that Aerospace used a       14:27:35

                 2   roughly 1.5 historical risk factor that is       14:27:40

                 3   based on a history of a broad set of over --     14:27:45

                 4   of 77 different NASA programs that has been      14:27:47

                 5   established by the Congressional Budget          14:27:53

                 6   Office and used by several different groups.     14:27:56

                 7   They used that 1.5 (sic) actually historical     14:28:00

                 8   risk factor on all of the element development    14:28:05

                 9   costs of all scenarios on the cost left to go    14:28:08

                10   in those scenarios.                              14:28:11

                11           We agreed on a lower historical risk     14:28:13

                12   of 1.25 for the production of elements and       14:28:16

                13   also on the operations costs, and it turns       14:28:23

                14   out that that 1.25 vice 1.5 for operations       14:28:27

                15   actually made a very, very large difference,     14:28:30

                16   which was interesting to me and something        14:28:34

                17   that I'm going to go back and try to             14:28:37

                18   understand a little bit more.                    14:28:41

                19           The second on the list is that we        14:28:43

                20   elected to add an additional 200 million --      14:28:47

                21   this is a one-time add -- to the COTS cargo      14:28:53

                22   baseline in FY '11, and this is really           14:29:01

                23   intended to incentivize the current COTS         14:29:01

                24   cargo demonstrations.  We've all come to         14:29:10

                25   realize how important the COTS cargo is to       14:29:10





                                                                70



                 1   the future of ISS, and we want to make sure      14:29:10

                 2   that there's incentive for them to perform as    14:29:21

                 3   we all hope they will.                           14:29:21

                 4           The next one, except for the current     14:29:21

                 5   international agreements that are assumed for    14:29:21

                 6   ISS and an extension of those same agreements    14:29:32

                 7   out through 2020, all of the elements in all     14:29:32

                 8   of the scenarios were fully costed, and we       14:29:32

                 9   did this just to make sure that we captured      14:29:43

                10   the full costs of the scenarios.                 14:29:43

                11           In other words, we didn't take credit    14:29:43

                12   if we thought that we could engage               14:29:43

                13   international partners to help defray some of    14:29:43

                14   the costs or take on the costing of some of      14:30:00

                15   the elements.  We thought that it was            14:30:00

                16   premature to do that and it was better to get    14:30:00

                17   the full costs at the very beginning of this     14:30:00

                18   process.                                         14:30:00

                19           Next, for each of the scenarios, with    14:30:00

                20   the exception of the program of record, we       14:30:00

                21   felt it was very, very important to introduce    14:30:00

                22   a specific technology line, and we started       14:30:23

                23   that technology program at $500 million in       14:30:23

                24   FY '11.  We ramped it up to 1.5 billion a        14:30:23

                25   year over a five-year period, and then we        14:30:23





                                                                71



                 1   maintained it at $1.5 billion a year for the     14:30:23

                 2   rest of the time that we considered.             14:30:23

                 3           As we looked a little bit more           14:30:56

                 4   closely at this, we realized that there was a    14:30:56

                 5   possibility for a little bit of                  14:30:56

                 6   double-counting in the technology that we        14:30:56

                 7   wanted to account for, both in the additions     14:30:56

                 8   that we've made to the ISS program as it's       14:30:56

                 9   extended and also in the existing EMSD lines,    14:30:56

                10   the exploration lines.  So the funding level     14:30:56

                11   that we actually put in, as I said, all          14:30:56

                12   scenarios except the program of record, which    14:30:56

                13   we're using as a baseline, actually ramp from    14:30:56

                14   250 million up to 750 million to help avoid      14:31:29

                15   the double-counting that we think is in the      14:31:29

                16   budget.                                          14:31:29

                17           But the intent is to have a very         14:31:29

                18   robust technology program that, in aggregate,    14:31:29

                19   will be about 1.5 billion a year.  Next.         14:31:29

                20           For all of the scenarios that assume     14:31:29

                21   Commercial Crew to LEO -- and you'll see that    14:31:29

                22   that is, in fact, most of the scenarios          14:31:54

                23   now -- we assume $2.5 billion in NASA            14:31:54

                24   investment over the four years ranging from      14:31:54

                25   FY '11 through '14.  And that is to make sure    14:31:54





                                                                72



                 1   that, as Bo said, we have robust competition     14:31:54

                 2   in which all of those who are interested and     14:31:54

                 3   eligible to compete and to participate will.     14:32:17

                 4           We feel that this is very important.     14:32:17

                 5   We would like to be able to get NASA out of      14:32:17

                 6   the business of getting people to low Earth      14:32:17

                 7   orbit, and we think that if we're going to be    14:32:17

                 8   serious about this we have to put some money     14:32:17

                 9   into the budget to do that.  So that line is     14:32:17

                10   in every scenario where Commercial Crew to       14:32:17

                11   LEO is foreseen.                                 14:32:43

                12           MR. GREASON:  Can I have one quick       14:32:43

                13   one on that one, Sally?                          14:32:43

                14           DR. RIDE:  Please.                       14:32:43

                15           MR. GREASON:  That line item is          14:32:43

                16   intended to be sufficiently large that           14:32:43

                17   multiple well-funded competitors will come to    14:32:43

                18   the table, so that we don't have to try to       14:32:43

                19   pick the winner up front, we can use the         14:32:43

                20   COTS-like model of funding several of them       14:32:43

                21   and picking whichever ones wind up being         14:32:43

                22   there.                                           14:32:43

                23           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         14:32:43

                24           MR. GREASON:  So that's the reason       14:32:43

                25   why that looks like a large number compared      14:32:43





                                                                73



                 1   to the cargo.                                    14:32:59

                 2           It also included a significant line      14:32:59

                 3   item for going through -- I hesitate to say      14:32:59

                 4   human rating but, you know, an enhanced          14:32:59

                 5   mission assurance process for some existing      14:32:59

                 6   booster that would be made available as one      14:32:59

                 7   of the options for all of the capsule            14:33:15

                 8   providers so that they don't have -- so that     14:33:15

                 9   even if we get new capsules but no new           14:33:15

                10   booster, we still get the capability.            14:33:15

                11           DR. RIDE:  Thank you.                    14:33:15

                12           The next one is that we'd use            14:33:15

                13   Aerospace's existing contract                    14:33:29

                14   termination/restart model and the actual         14:33:29

                15   contract termination costs in the                14:33:29

                16   Constellation programs.                          14:33:29

                17           The next one is that for all of the      14:33:29

                18   scenarios that include refueling we're           14:33:29

                19   assuming that the technology line actually       14:33:29

                20   funds that development.  So there's one          14:33:41

                21   example of a technology that we would foresee    14:33:41

                22   coming out of that technology line, and we       14:33:41

                23   also add $1 billion, just a one-time infusion    14:33:41

                24   to certify the fuel transfer kit.                14:33:58

                25           The next one is that for all sorties     14:33:58





                                                                74



                 1   that are -- that assume the lunar -- sorry --    14:33:58

                 2   for all scenarios that assume lunar sorties      14:33:58

                 3   and outposts we're actually using the            14:33:58

                 4   Constellation estimate for the Altair lander     14:33:58

                 5   and the lunar surface systems, just because      14:34:14

                 6   we didn't want to try to develop costs around    14:34:14

                 7   other systems.                                   14:34:14

                 8           For the Deep Space options we're         14:34:14

                 9   assuming a commercial lunar lander, but we're    14:34:14

                10   assuming government-furnished ascent stage.      14:34:14

                11   This is just to get -- just because when you     14:34:29

                12   get to putting numbers into budget models,       14:34:29

                13   you just have to specify a number for            14:34:29

                14   everything.  So we're trying to tell you the     14:34:29

                15   work that we had to go through here.  Next       14:34:29

                16   slide.                                           14:34:41

                17           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Sally, excuse me.        14:34:41

                18   Where you said you used the Altair model,        14:34:41

                19   that was adjusted, I assume, by Aerospace --     14:34:41

                20           DR. RIDE:  Yes.                          14:34:41

                21           MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- their factors?        14:34:41

                22           DR. RIDE:  Yes.  And I'll get to that    14:34:41

                23   in just a second.  But thank you, Norm.          14:34:55

                24           For all of the options that use          14:34:55

                25   commercial heavy-lift launch vehicles, we're     14:34:55





                                                                75



                 1   costing them as if NASA doesn't build the        14:34:55

                 2   system.  So this is a commercial buy, and we     14:35:13

                 3   use NASA infrastructure and the NASA             14:35:13

                 4   workforce only when it's required to conduct     14:35:13

                 5   the operations.  And we'll have more on that     14:35:13

                 6   in a minute.                                     14:35:13

                 7           The next one is for a shuttle-derived    14:35:13

                 8   scenario.  We're assuming sidemount costs,       14:35:34

                 9   but the Shuttle-Derived Systems scenario is      14:35:34

                10   intended to be a surrogate for a sidemount       14:35:34

                11   and an inline -- a very closely                  14:35:34

                12   shuttle-derived system.  Again, we needed to     14:35:34

                13   put in numbers from someplace and that's the     14:35:34

                14   set of numbers that we put in, but it's a        14:35:34

                15   surrogate.                                       14:35:53

                16           As for the current program elements,     14:35:53

                17   the shuttle and the station, for all             14:35:53

                18   scenarios that envision the ISS de-orbiting      14:35:53

                19   in 2016, we assumed an additional                14:35:53

                20   $1.5 billion cost beyond what's currently in     14:35:53

                21   NASA's budget for the decommissioning.  That     14:36:08

                22   is based on an independent Aerospace study       14:36:08

                23   looking at -- a very quick study but looking     14:36:08

                24   at an estimate of the order-of-magnitude job     14:36:08

                25   that it would be to de-orbit this very large     14:36:25





                                                                76



                 1   and very impressive structure.                   14:36:25

                 2           For any scenarios with -- that           14:36:25

                 3   contemplate just flying out the existing         14:36:25

                 4   shuttle manifest, as we have discussed, we're    14:36:25

                 5   assuming that it -- a more prudent fly-out       14:36:36

                 6   scenario that would take the current manifest    14:36:36

                 7   out to March of 2011.  Next one.                 14:36:36

                 8           MR. BEJMUK:  Sally, may I?               14:36:45

                 9           DR. RIDE:  Please.                       14:36:45

                10           MR. BEJMUK:  You know, on this --        14:36:45

                11   just a question on this:  For options using      14:36:45

                12   EELV heavy-lift vehicles, cost as if NASA        14:36:53

                13   does not build system and NASA infrastructure    14:36:53

                14   and workforce only when required to conduct      14:36:58

                15   the operations.                                  14:36:58

                16           You know, NASA doesn't build today's     14:37:01

                17   systems.  NASA didn't build the previous         14:37:04

                18   system.  Contractors built it.  I was one of     14:37:06

                19   those guys, you know.  So to say that this is    14:37:10

                20   something new is really not all that             14:37:15

                21   accurate.                                        14:37:15

                22           NASA has always been the architect of    14:37:15

                23   the system, has been a partner in the            14:37:20

                24   design -- they had these so-called subsystem     14:37:25

                25   engineers who were guys who knew, you know,      14:37:25





                                                                77



                 1   technical aspects of the various subsystems.     14:37:28

                 2   But the building of the vehicles was always      14:37:29

                 3   done by contractors.                             14:37:32

                 4           So I'm just cautioning all of us so      14:37:33

                 5   we don't think like we are, like, creating       14:37:35

                 6   some kind of a drastically new scenario here.    14:37:41

                 7   I think we are talking about how you acquire     14:37:45

                 8   that same -- contractors will be building        14:37:49

                 9   things just like they always have in the         14:37:49

                10   past.                                            14:37:53

                11           DR. RIDE:  You know, in part, that's     14:37:55

                12   true.                                            14:37:57

                13           MR. BEJMUK:  We are buying it            14:37:57

                14   differently.  Is that correct?                   14:37:57

                15           DR. RIDE:  We're buying differently.     14:37:58

                16   And this was a shorthand to just say -- as is    14:37:59

                17   going to hit us hard in the face in one of       14:38:04

                18   these charts coming up later and we know that    14:38:07

                19   you're going to comment on, Bo -- there's --     14:38:13

                20   we're doing one of these scenarios in a very     14:38:17

                21   different buy model, and that is all that        14:38:20

                22   we're trying to capture here -- was the          14:38:24

                23   intent that we need to do -- that we have        14:38:26

                24   done work around trying to identify what that    14:38:28

                25   model is.  So we're going to see the             14:38:30





                                                                78



                 1   implications of that model and more detail       14:38:37

                 2   about what we mean by it in -- I'm hoping        14:38:37

                 3   that I get pulled off of the stage before I      14:38:43

                 4   get to that one, but I don't think it's going    14:38:47

                 5   to happen.                                       14:38:50

                 6           DR. CHIAO:  Sally, before you --         14:38:50

                 7           DR. RIDE:  Yes, please.                  14:38:50

                 8           DR. CHIAO:  -- jump into the numbers,    14:38:50

                 9   can I just -- you already kind of stated         14:38:52

                10   it -- well, you stated it in your charts and     14:38:54

                11   so did Ed, but I just wanted to make it clear    14:38:54

                12   that in the options that we're -- or the         14:39:00

                13   scenarios where we're talking about using        14:39:00

                14   commercial for access to LEO, we're talking      14:39:00

                15   about -- we're still going to use Orion for      14:39:05

                16   exploration, but it's the -- the LEO vehicles    14:39:05

                17   are the new ones that are going to be            14:39:13

                18   developed.                                       14:39:13

                19           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  I think --             14:39:13

                20           DR. CHIAO:  So I just wanted to make     14:39:13

                21   sure that's clear.                               14:39:13

                22           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  Thank you for that     14:39:28

                23   clarification.                                   14:39:28

                24           We'll see that Orion line in all of      14:39:28

                25   the budget charts.  But it's absolutely true     14:39:28





                                                                79



                 1   we're planning to use Orion as the               14:39:28

                 2   exploration vehicle, but Commercial Crew to      14:39:28

                 3   LEO would be with a commercial capsule and a     14:39:28

                 4   commercial -- and, you know, whatever the        14:39:28

                 5   commercial entities think is a good solution.    14:39:41

                 6           I should also probably -- before I       14:39:41

                 7   start talking to this first little reminder      14:39:41

                 8   of the budget situation chart -- that we've      14:39:41

                 9   got a whole variety of scenarios here.  We've    14:39:57

                10   talked about this before.  Some of the           14:39:57

                11   scenarios and some of the elements within the    14:39:57

                12   different scenarios are much more mature than    14:39:57

                13   others in terms of their definition, the         14:39:57

                14   fidelity of their costing.                       14:40:12

                15           That's something that we had to deal     14:40:12

                16   with head on and try to understand and try to    14:40:12

                17   level the playing field.  It's very difficult    14:40:12

                18   to do when we're dealing with some things        14:40:12

                19   that are close to reality and have at least      14:40:26

                20   been through a preliminary design review and     14:40:26

                21   other things that are -- as, I think, Ed has     14:40:26

                22   certainly said, you know, it's like --           14:40:26

                23   they're like paper rockets.                      14:40:26

                24           So we spent a fair amount of time        14:40:38

                25   trying to make sure that we were using a         14:40:38





                                                                80



                 1   level playing field, as level as we could        14:40:38

                 2   make it, in this assessment.                     14:40:38

                 3           And I want to make it also clear that    14:40:38

                 4   all of these scenarios were handled by           14:40:38

                 5   Aerospace through their costing models using     14:40:52

                 6   the same formulation, the same methodology.      14:40:52

                 7   So we understand that there are risks in         14:40:52

                 8   comparing, you know, my rocket with your view    14:41:03

                 9   graphs, but that's -- you know, I want to        14:41:03

                10   make the point that we tried as hard as we       14:41:03

                11   could to level the playing field here and be     14:41:11

                12   able to make reasonable comparisons.             14:41:11

                13           So the chart that we've got up now is    14:41:20

                14   actually -- it's a chart that you've seen        14:41:20

                15   before.  I showed it in Houston, I think.        14:41:20

                16   And I think it's been shown at least one         14:41:28

                17   other time.  This is just a very quick           14:41:28

                18   reminder of how we got to where we are.          14:41:28

                19           The top line is the money that was       14:41:37

                20   anticipated for the Constellation program        14:41:37

                21   when the vision for space exploration was        14:41:37

                22   adopted.  You know, things happened over         14:41:43

                23   time.                                            14:41:52

                24           The second line was the FY '09           14:41:52

                25   run-out of the budget for the exploration        14:41:52





                                                                81



                 1   program.                                         14:42:04

                 2           The Fiscal '10 budget that we are        14:42:04

                 3   asked to fit to is the third line down, the      14:42:04

                 4   orange line, and that shows you that quite       14:42:15

                 5   significant additional reductions were taken     14:42:15

                 6   just in going from the FY '09 budget to the      14:42:15

                 7   FY '10 budget.                                   14:42:22

                 8           And by the way, it's important to        14:42:22

                 9   remember, again, that the FY '10 budget          14:42:30

                10   run-out assumes that ISS is de-orbited in        14:42:30

                11   2016.  So if you want to extend ISS, then the    14:42:39

                12   money that you're presumably taking away from    14:42:39

                13   the exploration program is also fairly           14:42:39

                14   significant, and that's that green line.         14:42:50

                15           So it's perhaps no surprise that         14:42:50

                16   we're where we are.  A program that was          14:42:50

                17   envisioned to be funded at the top line on       14:42:50

                18   that chart is now facing a budget at the         14:43:01

                19   bottom line of the chart, and that's a           14:43:01

                20   significant amount of money that's been taken    14:43:15

                21   out of the entire program over a relatively      14:43:15

                22   short period of time.                            14:43:15

                23           And if you just take a look at the       14:43:15

                24   difference between the top line and the green    14:43:15

                25   line right at the end of the chart, that's an    14:43:15





                                                                82



                 1   average of about $3 billion a year               14:43:33

                 2   difference.  So it's not a small difference      14:43:33

                 3   that we're talking about.  Next slide.           14:43:33

                 4           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Sally, because of the    14:43:33

                 5   amount of detail here, I think we better ask     14:43:33

                 6   questions as we go along, if that's all right    14:43:33

                 7   with you.                                        14:43:33

                 8           DR. RIDE:  Please.  Please.              14:43:57

                 9           MR. AUGUSTINE:  The question I wanted    14:43:57

                10   to ask -- and I've been chasing this, and        14:43:57

                11   maybe you've got it nailed down.  This top       14:43:57

                12   line on anticipated funding, my question is      14:43:57

                13   the authenticity of that line.                   14:43:57

                14           Was that a NASA want, or was that        14:43:57

                15   something approved by the President and the      14:43:57

                16   Congress?  What's its authority?                 14:43:57

                17           DR. RIDE:  You know, I have frankly      14:43:57

                18   forgotten the answer to that question.           14:43:57

                19           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Does anybody --          14:43:57

                20           DR. RIDE:  I think that it is more       14:44:24

                21   than NASA's ask, but it may be less than the     14:44:24

                22   FY '06 budget.  But the original funding for     14:44:24

                23   the budget was quite a bit higher than the       14:44:24

                24   FY '09 budget.                                   14:44:24

                25           MR. AUGUSTINE:  We need to nail that     14:44:24





                                                                83



                 1   down.                                            14:44:24

                 2           DR. RIDE:  We do.  We do.                14:44:24

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  Sally, it's only a         14:44:24

                 4   little worse than this.  Because I think that    14:44:52

                 5   at this point it's worth, once again, stating    14:44:52

                 6   that the numbers that we're going to show for    14:44:52

                 7   the budget are the analysis from the             14:44:52

                 8   Aerospace Corporation, which will include the    14:44:52

                 9   historical growth factors for cost over and      14:44:52

                10   above the costs that have historically been      14:44:52

                11   carried and reported by NASA in the program,     14:44:52

                12   so that not only are we trying to fit under      14:44:52

                13   the green line rather than -- well, even only    14:44:52

                14   a few months ago under the red line -- but       14:45:19

                15   that we're doing it with what we think are       14:45:19

                16   much more historically valid maximum likely      14:45:19

                17   estimated costs of the program.                  14:45:19

                18           DR. RIDE:  I'll actually agree with      14:45:19

                19   that but give NASA a little bit of credit        14:45:19

                20   here.  Because as you'll see, we've got a        14:45:19

                21   case that somewhat serendipitously fits the      14:45:19

                22   program of record to what we've called a less    14:45:43

                23   constrained budget that, it turns out, is        14:45:43

                24   actually rather similar to that top line and     14:45:43

                25   it's pretty darn close to what NASA planned      14:45:43





                                                                84



                 1   the Constellation program to and the program     14:45:43

                 2   comes pretty close to performing as NASA         14:45:43

                 3   advertised it would even if that -- even with    14:46:06

                 4   that 1.5 historical risk put in.                 14:46:06

                 5           So what that means is that NASA's        14:46:06

                 6   planning in the development of the -- the        14:46:06

                 7   development phase of the Constellation           14:46:06

                 8   program was actually pretty good.  I think       14:46:06

                 9   that we've almost re-derived how they came up    14:46:06

                10   with the costs that they came up with.  And      14:46:06

                11   we'll see that chart in a little while.          14:46:24

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  But you understand that    14:46:24

                13   I'm trying to emphasize this point because       14:46:24

                14   there are some people in Washington -- for       14:46:24

                15   example, the Congressional Budget Office --      14:46:24

                16   who have argued that there are historical        14:46:24

                17   cost growths in NASA programs and that we        14:46:24

                18   think that we've used an appropriate -- well,    14:46:24

                19   we're trusting the input of the Aerospace        14:46:44

                20   Corporation -- that we've used an appropriate    14:46:44

                21   expectation multiple already in these            14:46:44

                22   numbers.                                         14:46:44

                23           DR. RIDE:  Uh-huh.  And it's not a       14:46:44

                24   bad idea to take just another minute to talk     14:46:44

                25   about that multiple.                             14:46:44





                                                                85



                 1           You know, as I said, the                 14:46:44

                 2   Congressional Budget Office did an assessment    14:46:44

                 3   of 77 NASA programs that ranged from, you        14:47:07

                 4   know, relatively small robotic programs up to    14:47:07

                 5   very large human programs and looked at the      14:47:07

                 6   average cost overrun and came up with this,      14:47:07

                 7   you know, factor of 1.5 to 1.  And they also     14:47:07

                 8   looked at it from over the lifetime of the       14:47:07

                 9   program, the program from PDR until the end      14:47:07

                10   of the program, the time from CDR to the end     14:47:35

                11   of the program, et cetera.  So it was a          14:47:35

                12   reasonably complete analysis -- came up with     14:47:35

                13   that 1.51.                                       14:47:35

                14           I think the first question that          14:47:35

                15   occurred to a lot of us was, well, wait a        14:47:35

                16   minute, that included a lot of small robotics    14:47:35

                17   programs, what would it look like if you did     14:47:35

                18   it just with the human programs.  And it         14:47:35

                19   turns out that in that case it's a factor of     14:47:35

                20   2, not a factor of 1.51.                         14:47:35

                21           So, you know, that made me believe       14:48:07

                22   that, you know, the historical risk is           14:48:07

                23   probably a very, very valuable thing to put      14:48:07

                24   in.  Because, you know, I think, as one of       14:48:07

                25   our NASA colleagues said earlier, you know,      14:48:07





                                                                86



                 1   stuff happens and it just always does and        14:48:07

                 2   some of it you can plan for and some of you      14:48:07

                 3   put reserves in for but history shows that       14:48:07

                 4   that stuff gets you.                             14:48:07

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  The problem, of          14:48:07

                 6   course, with this is that if you're a program    14:48:07

                 7   manager you're damned by your predecessors.      14:48:07

                 8   On the other hand, if you're going to            14:48:48

                 9   Las Vegas, this is the way to bet.               14:48:48

                10           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  That's right.  And     14:48:48

                11   I think that Wanda made the point, in seeing     14:48:48

                12   this chart and talking about the 1.5 when we     14:48:48

                13   were just having a brief discussion, that        14:48:48

                14   often when this stuff happens, you know, you     14:48:48

                15   might -- and you know stuff has just             14:48:48

                16   happened, well, you might slip the               14:48:48

                17   schedule or you might thin down the content a    14:48:48

                18   little bit in order to meet the schedule.  So    14:48:48

                19   there are things that a program manager does     14:48:48

                20   to try to manage this.                           14:48:48

                21           DR. AUSTIN:  Sally, let me just add      14:49:22

                22   one other point to that, which, I think,         14:49:22

                23   we've touched on the past, which is it           14:49:22

                24   doesn't do you a lot of good to get the          14:49:22

                25   dollars later either, sort of adding more        14:49:22





                                                                87



                 1   dollars at the end, which is, you know, sort     14:49:22

                 2   of the argument that we get into, which is in    14:49:22

                 3   future years, you know, the money will be        14:49:22

                 4   there and we'll be able to execute that.         14:49:22

                 5   That's fraught with, you know, additional        14:49:22

                 6   risks and an additional costs in order to do     14:49:22

                 7   the program then in an un-optimum way.           14:49:22

                 8           DR. RIDE:  Absolutely.                   14:49:22

                 9           MR. McALISTER:  One more thing to        14:49:22

                10   add --                                           14:49:22

                11           DR. RIDE:  Next slide.                   14:49:22

                12           MR. McALISTER:  I'm sorry.               14:49:22

                13           DR. RIDE:  Go ahead.                     14:49:22

                14           MR. McALISTER:  Norm, just to provide    14:49:22

                15   a little bit of clarification on this top        14:49:22

                16   line and why it's so difficult for you to get    14:49:55

                17   that nailed down -- and I have to be very        14:49:55

                18   careful when I speak here because the budget     14:49:55

                19   is something that's -- there's a lot of          14:49:55

                20   intense discussion about that.                   14:49:55

                21           But officially the President's budget    14:49:55

                22   only goes out for five years.  So when we got    14:49:55

                23   the ESAS -- when NASA got the ESAS budget in     14:49:55

                24   2004/2005, officially the only thing that was    14:49:55

                25   agreed to by all parties was in that -- was      14:49:55





                                                                88



                 1   for a five-year period out to 2010.  Beyond      14:49:55

                 2   that, it gets into assumptions, assumptions      14:49:55

                 3   of what the inflation rate is, assumptions of    14:49:55

                 4   what -- other factors that go into those         14:50:24

                 5   out-years, and it becomes -- and that sort of    14:50:24

                 6   gets negotiated at the staffer level.            14:50:24

                 7           So it's even inaccurate to say "the      14:50:24

                 8   President's budget request" and put a line       14:50:24

                 9   out that far.  It's really just five years.      14:50:24

                10           DR. RIDE:  Sure.                         14:50:24

                11           MR. McALISTER:  And then after that,     14:50:24

                12   it becomes assumptions.  So that's why it's      14:50:24

                13   very difficult to answer that question           14:50:24

                14   clearly.  It's what we thought we had, what      14:50:24

                15   parties thought they gave us and what was        14:50:24

                16   agreed to.  It's not really official except      14:50:24

                17   that five-year budget.                           14:50:24

                18           MR. AUGUSTINE:  But that's very bad      14:50:24

                19   news.  Because if in 2004 you had the next       14:50:24

                20   five years, I would say in 2009 the only         14:50:56

                21   thing you were assured of was the first point    14:50:56

                22   on the blue line, which just about is where      14:50:56

                23   the green line is today.  So it says we're       14:50:56

                24   just about where we were then.                   14:50:56

                25           MR. McALISTER:  That's correct.          14:50:56





                                                                89



                 1           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         14:50:56

                 2           MR. AUGUSTINE:  So everything above      14:50:56

                 3   that was wish list.                              14:50:56

                 4           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  Next slide.            14:50:56

                 5           Very quickly let me run through the      14:50:56

                 6   methodology that Aerospace used for, again,      14:50:56

                 7   all of the scenarios.  They built up the         14:50:56

                 8   budget charts for a particular scenario.         14:51:24

                 9   They didn't constrain that -- didn't             14:51:24

                10   constrain the budget.  They just built up --     14:51:24

                11   build up the pieces.                             14:51:24

                12           Then in Step 2 they fit those            14:51:24

                13   scenario costs to a given budget, perhaps the    14:51:24

                14   FY '10 constrained budget that we were given     14:51:24

                15   to work for, as an example, and they used        14:51:24

                16   schedule as the independent variable and just    14:51:24

                17   deterministically let the schedule fall where    14:51:24

                18   it would.  Then they allocated funding and       14:51:52

                19   reserves to raise the total program costs to     14:51:52

                20   about 60 percent -- 65 percent likelihood of     14:51:52

                21   meeting that cost.                               14:51:52

                22           Then in Step 3 they went through         14:51:52

                23   Monte Carlo analysis to take a look at the       14:51:52

                24   impact of the technical historical risks --      14:51:52

                25   technical and historical risks on the actual     14:51:52





                                                                90



                 1   execution of this scenario.                      14:51:52

                 2           And so that is how we got the results    14:52:21

                 3   that we've got.  So next slide.                  14:52:21

                 4           Let's start talking about budgets.       14:52:21

                 5   The first one we're going to take a look at      14:52:21

                 6   is the program of record.  This is sort of       14:52:21

                 7   our derived baseline here.                       14:52:21

                 8           This is the program of record, the       14:52:21

                 9   existing Constellation program, and its          14:52:21

                10   budget.  We're taking the realistic shuttle      14:52:46

                11   fly-out to March 2011 because we just think      14:52:46

                12   that that's a very prudent thing to do and       14:52:46

                13   we're assuming ISS retirement in early 2016,     14:52:46

                14   which the program of record assumes, and the     14:52:46

                15   commercial and international engagement is as    14:52:46

                16   it is in the current program.  Next slide.       14:52:46

                17           This is what it looks like.  This is     14:53:08

                18   the unconstrained budget.  If I could see the    14:53:08

                19   small print in each of those lines of sand,      14:53:08

                20   I'd let you know what they are, but as you       14:53:08

                21   can see, each different color represents an      14:53:08

                22   element of the program.  So the bottom light     14:53:08

                23   green is Orion.  I think the next one up is      14:53:28

                24   Ares I.  The next blue line up is Ares V.        14:53:28

                25   Then I think we've got ground operations,        14:53:28





                                                                91



                 1   probably Altair next in the dark green, light    14:53:28

                 2   green...                                         14:53:28

                 3           Thank you, Leroy.                        14:53:28

                 4           MR. McALISTER:  Other Cx elements,       14:53:48

                 5   Lunar Surface systems in yellow and then         14:53:48

                 6   Other Non-CX elements in orange.                 14:53:48

                 7           DR. RIDE:  Thanks.                       14:53:48

                 8           MR. McALISTER:  And then you've got      14:53:48

                 9   the dark -- and towards the left is ISS.         14:53:48

                10   Towards the left again is shuttle.               14:53:48

                11           DR. RIDE:  Right.  And you'll see        14:53:48

                12   that ISS -- that the shuttle extends only out    14:53:48

                13   to 2011, and then there are some termination     14:53:48

                14   retirement costs.  ISS is terminated in early    14:54:03

                15   2016.                                            14:54:03

                16           So this is what all of the charts        14:54:03

                17   that you're going to see are going to look       14:54:03

                18   like.  These are going to start blending         14:54:03

                19   together after a while, but the format is        14:54:03

                20   going to be consistent.  I think even the        14:54:21

                21   color scheme is consistent.  The lines at the    14:54:21

                22   top show particular milestones -- shuttle        14:54:21

                23   retirement, ISS retirement.  The red lines       14:54:21

                24   are showing capabilities coming online.          14:54:21

                25           So in the unconstrained budget, Orion    14:54:21





                                                                92



                 1   and Ares I, you know, arrive shortly after       14:54:38

                 2   ISS is de-orbited, and then you get human        14:54:38

                 3   lunar return in -- I think that's 2021.          14:54:38

                 4           Thank you, Leroy.                        14:54:52

                 5           DR. CHIAO:  You're welcome.              14:54:52

                 6           DR. RIDE:  So this is in the             14:54:52

                 7   constrained budget.  And then the thing to       14:54:52

                 8   look at is how much above the budget that we     14:54:52

                 9   are supposed to be fitting to it is.  That       14:54:52

                10   budget is the black dashed line that goes all    14:55:06

                11   of the way across at roughly $9 billion a        14:55:06

                12   year -- if you want to try to find that black    14:55:06

                13   line.                                            14:55:06

                14           So this shows you, in a given year,      14:55:06

                15   how many billions of dollars over that budget    14:55:25

                16   this unconstrained program of record would       14:55:25

                17   be.  Next slide.                                 14:55:25

                18           MR. GREASON:  Sally, before you move     14:55:25

                19   on, this is a truly excellent slide to point     14:55:25

                20   out graphically what we've talked about          14:55:25

                21   verbally.                                        14:55:43

                22           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         14:55:43

                23           MR. GREASON:  Which is the focus         14:55:43

                24   tends to be very much on what do these           14:55:43

                25   systems take to develop, but the really          14:55:43





                                                                93



                 1   dominant effect, as you look out at the right    14:55:43

                 2   part of the chart -- and you discover that we    14:55:43

                 3   are on a path right now for a system that        14:55:43

                 4   requires on the close order of double the        14:55:43

                 5   current budget just to operate.                  14:55:43

                 6           DR. RIDE:  Uh-huh.  That's the           14:55:56

                 7   steady-state numbers.  You see can you're        14:55:56

                 8   kind of approaching steady-state there out       14:55:56

                 9   in --                                            14:55:56

                10           MR. GREASON:  Right.                     14:55:56

                11           DR. RIDE:  -- 2028 or so, and that's     14:55:56

                12   the operations.                                  14:55:56

                13           MR. GREASON:  If Santa Claus brought     14:55:56

                14   us this system tomorrow fully developed and      14:56:07

                15   the budget didn't change, our next action        14:56:07

                16   would have to be to cancel it.                   14:56:07

                17           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         14:56:07

                18           MR. McALISTER:  And, Sally, could you    14:56:13

                19   give us an estimate as to the integral           14:56:13

                20   between the top line and the sort of dashed      14:56:13

                21   line --                                          14:56:17

                22           DR. RIDE:  Let's see.                    14:56:17

                23           MR. McALISTER:  -- ballpark?             14:56:17

                24           DR. RIDE:  Leroy, is that --             14:56:17

                25           DR. CHIAO:  49.                          14:56:17





                                                                94



                 1           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  So it looks like       14:56:17

                 2   the integral FY '10 through '30 is               14:56:21

                 3   307 billion.                                     14:56:30

                 4           MR. McALISTER:  No.  Just above --       14:56:32

                 5   what's just above the dashed line?               14:56:33

                 6           DR. RIDE:  The dash --                   14:56:33

                 7           MR. McALISTER:  What's the overages?     14:56:33

                 8           DR. RIDE:  So the dash -- let's see.     14:56:34

                 9   The dash -- let me give you out through 2020,    14:56:34

                10   because I know that, okay.  2020 the integral    14:56:37

                11   under the dashed line is 99.2 billion.           14:56:42

                12           MR. McALISTER:  Okay.                    14:56:42

                13           DR. RIDE:  That's not on the chart.      14:56:47

                14   And then you can look here, the -- it's 149.     14:56:47

                15   So it's 50 billion over out to 2020.             14:56:51

                16           MR. McALISTER:  Thank you.               14:56:54

                17           DR. RIDE:  Uh-huh.  Next slide.          14:56:56

                18           All right.  This one is going to be      14:56:58

                19   the fit of this program to the President's       14:57:01

                20   budget.  So, now, Aerospace is now doing         14:57:05

                21   another set of runs that will essentially        14:57:09

                22   squash and push to fit this program into the     14:57:13

                23   budget that we have been asked to meet --        14:57:17

                24   that we've been asked to fit things to.  So      14:57:19

                25   we're still assuming the fly-out in twenty --    14:57:24





                                                                95



                 1   March of '11, ISS retirement in 2016.  Next      14:57:28

                 2   slide.                                           14:57:32

                 3           Okay.  So that's what it looks like.     14:57:36

                 4   And, you know, it's a computer, so you can do    14:57:40

                 5   anything you want.  You can actually make a      14:57:43

                 6   chart look like this that fits the budget,       14:57:48

                 7   but if you take a look at this budget, you       14:57:48

                 8   can see that there are a few things wrong        14:57:53

                 9   with it.                                         14:57:53

                10           One is that you get, again, Orion and    14:57:53

                11   Ares I capability of crew to LEO a couple of     14:57:59

                12   years after ISS is gone.  So there's nothing     14:57:59

                13   for Ares I and Orion to go to.                   14:58:07

                14           You do get a heavy-lift out in 2028,     14:58:07

                15   but you'll notice that there are no lunar        14:58:20

                16   systems that have been developed.  There was     14:58:20

                17   not enough money to even start the lunar         14:58:20

                18   systems.  So you have a heavy-lift vehicle in    14:58:20

                19   2028 but absolutely nothing to put in it to      14:58:31

                20   send it to the Moon.                             14:58:31

                21           So this says it pretty well.  You        14:58:31

                22   cannot do this program on this budget.  And      14:58:39

                23   it's just back to Norm's basic message, you      14:58:39

                24   know, if you want to do something, you have      14:58:45

                25   to have the money to do it.                      14:58:45





                                                                96



                 1           This chart and actually several of --    14:58:49

                 2   as we started doing a lot of runs on a lot of    14:58:54

                 3   these different scenarios, we kept coming up     14:58:58

                 4   with a common theme, which was this budget is    14:59:00

                 5   very, very, very hard to fit within and still    14:59:04

                 6   have an exploration program.  In fact, we are    14:59:10

                 7   still looking for an existence proof that we     14:59:13

                 8   can actually find one.  So we haven't found      14:59:19

                 9   one yet, but we're still looking.  We've only    14:59:22

                10   been working on this for 160 hours.              14:59:27

                11           Because of that, we decided that we      14:59:31

                12   needed to ask a slightly different question.     14:59:31

                13   We needed to say, well, what if we tried to      14:59:38

                14   fit it to something that was a less              14:59:38

                15   constrained budget.  So next slide.              14:59:38

                16           We tried to fit the program of record    14:59:47

                17   to a less constrained budget.  It's the same     14:59:47

                18   thing.  And go on to the next slide.             14:59:47

                19           This is what we chose as the less        15:00:02

                20   constrained budget.  We had quite a              15:00:02

                21   discussion about what budget line to choose.     15:00:02

                22   We decided to kind of split the difference,      15:00:02

                23   and we didn't want to make that budget line      15:00:02

                24   too small, because then we were afraid that      15:00:23

                25   we'd not be able to accomplish any               15:00:23





                                                                97



                 1   exploration.  We didn't want to make it too      15:00:23

                 2   large because then we'd be just be laughed       15:00:23

                 3   off the stage.                                   15:00:23

                 4           So we chose the red line that you can    15:00:23

                 5   see there.  It ramps up slowly to 3 billion a    15:00:23

                 6   year over the budget that we've been given,      15:00:23

                 7   and then it stays at a constant 3 billion a      15:00:50

                 8   year over that budget out until 2020.  And       15:00:50

                 9   then we allow that red line to grow with         15:00:50

                10   inflation at a rate of 2.4 percent per year.     15:00:50

                11   Now, that's important because the run-out        15:00:50

                12   budget that we've been given grows at            15:00:50

                13   inflation -- at an inflation rate of only        15:00:50

                14   1.4 percent per year all of the way out to       15:00:50

                15   2030.                                            15:01:16

                16           You can immediately understand the       15:01:16

                17   problems that the program is in trying to fit    15:01:16

                18   that budget.  Every year you go, you have        15:01:16

                19   less buying power than you had the year          15:01:16

                20   before if inflation was actually greater than    15:01:16

                21   1.4 percent.  Next slide.                        15:01:16

                22           So this is the Constellation program,    15:01:16

                23   the program of record, fit to the less           15:01:16

                24   constrained budget.  And this one, it -- you     15:01:16

                25   know, again, this is a computer, so you can      15:01:46





                                                                98



                 1   always fit these things into whatever budget     15:01:46

                 2   you want hand the schedule kind of falls out.    15:01:46

                 3           And this turns out to be a fairly        15:01:46

                 4   reasonable program.  Ares I and Orion arrive     15:01:46

                 5   in late 2016.  That's not too much of a          15:01:46

                 6   delay.  It's after ISS has been de-orbited.      15:01:46

                 7   So, again, there's nothing for them to           15:01:46

                 8   service, but they're there not too far behind    15:02:14

                 9   schedule.                                        15:02:14

                10           You get human lunar return in 2025.      15:02:14

                11   And, now, this is the chart that you can use     15:02:14

                12   to envision -- it turns out that that red        15:02:14

                13   line is pretty close to the envisioned           15:02:14

                14   ESAS -- the envisioned program at the time of    15:02:14

                15   the vision for space exploration.  So this is    15:02:14

                16   fairly close to the budget that Constellation    15:02:14

                17   thought it was going to have.  You know, at      15:02:39

                18   least a first order, it's within that.           15:02:39

                19           And if you think we're kind of almost    15:02:39

                20   five years beyond that and this slips human      15:02:39

                21   lunar return almost five years, you can see      15:02:39

                22   that the Constellation program did a pretty      15:02:39

                23   reasonable job of projecting and estimating      15:02:39

                24   with the budget that they were working under.    15:02:39

                25   Next slide.                                      15:03:02





                                                                99



                 1           So that's the program of record and      15:03:02

                 2   what it looks like.                              15:03:02

                 3           Now I want to talk about some of the     15:03:02

                 4   new scenarios.                                   15:03:02

                 5           And I think that -- you know, that       15:03:02

                 6   fitting the program of record to the FY '10      15:03:02

                 7   President's budget and the run-out guidance      15:03:02

                 8   that we've been given that shows you --          15:03:02

                 9   again, that's the "why are we here" slide.       15:03:02

                10   That's the "what's the reason for this           15:03:28

                11   committee."  You know, the program of record     15:03:28

                12   doesn't fit under the current budget.  So we     15:03:28

                13   have to be looking at different scenarios.       15:03:28

                14           So now let's start looking at some of    15:03:28

                15   the scenarios that Ed has described.  For all    15:03:28

                16   of these scenarios that follow, we added the     15:03:28

                17   technology line that I described, we added       15:03:28

                18   the initial -- the additional $200 million       15:03:28

                19   for COTS cargo that I described.  All that       15:03:56

                20   envisioned Commercial Crew to LEO, we've         15:03:56

                21   added the 2.5 billion between '11 and '14.       15:03:56

                22           The next set of scenarios are the        15:03:56

                23   ones that we thought actually had a chance to    15:03:56

                24   fit under the constrained budget, the FY '10     15:03:56

                25   budget.  So these are the ones that on Ed's      15:04:23





                                                               100



                 1   chart showed fit to the FY '10 budget.  Those    15:04:23

                 2   two are the ISS -- the ones we called            15:04:23

                 3   ISS Focused and the one we called Dash Out of    15:04:23

                 4   LEO.                                             15:04:23

                 5           Now, again, all of these have gone       15:04:23

                 6   through the same assessment process by           15:04:23

                 7   Aerospace Corporation using the methodology      15:04:23

                 8   that I just very briefly outlined and working    15:04:23

                 9   with the NASA teams to get the costing of the    15:04:23

                10   elements and the assumptions.  Next one.         15:04:57

                11           So first let's look at ISS Focused.      15:04:57

                12   This is with Commercial Crew to LEO.             15:04:57

                13           I should say that we first ran this      15:04:57

                14   case assuming Ares I, and it -- under these      15:04:57

                15   budget constraints, it was not able to get to    15:04:57

                16   ISS and service ISS until about a year left      15:04:57

                17   in its life.  So I don't remember what year      15:04:57

                18   it came in.  It might have been 2019 or so       15:04:57

                19   with an ISS extension out to 2020.               15:05:30

                20           It was very obvious with the first       15:05:30

                21   run that the Ares I in this -- as part of        15:05:30

                22   this scenario just didn't work, and so we        15:05:30

                23   switched over to the commercial -- not           15:05:30

                24   switched over.  We were going to do that         15:05:30

                25   anyway, but we -- we're just showing the         15:05:30





                                                               101



                 1   Commercial Crew to LEO.                          15:05:30

                 2           So this scenario, we just -- our         15:05:30

                 3   focus is primarily on ISS in this decade, fit    15:05:30

                 4   to the FY '10 budget, shuttle fly-out in         15:05:30

                 5   March '11, ISS is extended into 2020 and         15:06:10

                 6   we're trying to foster the commercial and        15:06:10

                 7   international engagement.  We haven't taken      15:06:10

                 8   any credits for international participation,     15:06:10

                 9   but you -- but we did put the money in for       15:06:10

                10   Commercial Crew to LEO.  Next slide.             15:06:10

                11           This is what it looks like when it's     15:06:10

                12   constrained to budget.                           15:06:10

                13           I've actually got these.  Thanks.        15:06:10

                14           So it fits.  The commercial crew we      15:06:10

                15   have getting there in mid 2016 to support        15:06:10

                16   ISS.  You need to buy a couple of extra Soyuz    15:06:10

                17   flights to make up that time.  But the           15:06:52

                18   Commercial Crew to LEO can support ISS.  This    15:06:52

                19   does include the technology program.             15:06:52

                20           But look at what happens to              15:06:52

                21   exploration in this.  We tried to keep           15:06:52

                22   some -- I mean, the whole point of our work      15:06:52

                23   is to try to develop a strategy for human        15:06:52

                24   exploration, and so we did not want to just      15:06:52

                25   throw away exploration but see what happened     15:06:52





                                                               102



                 1   to it in this scenario.  And it essentially      15:06:52

                 2   disappears.                                      15:06:52

                 3           You get Ares V and Orion in 2028.  So    15:06:52

                 4   you get a heavy lifter, but you, again, were     15:07:32

                 5   unable to afford even starting the lunar         15:07:32

                 6   surface systems.  So, again, if you're           15:07:32

                 7   willing to wait until 2028, you've got a         15:07:32

                 8   heavy-lift vehicle, but you've got nothing to    15:07:32

                 9   lift.                                            15:07:32

                10           Because of this problem with this        15:07:32

                11   particular scenario, you know, we just didn't    15:07:32

                12   like this.  This is a don't do anything          15:07:32

                13   different and don't -- you know, don't start     15:07:32

                14   an exploration because it doesn't make sense.    15:07:32

                15   You'd never design a program this way.           15:07:32

                16           We actually decided to look at this      15:07:32

                17   scenario under the less constrained case, the    15:07:32

                18   different budget that I described.  So that's    15:07:32

                19   the next slide.                                  15:08:13

                20           DR. CRAWLEY:  Sally?                     15:08:13

                21           DR. RIDE:  Yes.                          15:08:13

                22           DR. CRAWLEY:  Before you leave this,     15:08:13

                23   I think this chart -- just another way of        15:08:13

                24   saying what you just said about you really       15:08:13

                25   wouldn't do this is to look at the blue slug     15:08:13





                                                               103



                 1   in the next decade.                              15:08:13

                 2           Although there's a broad political       15:08:13

                 3   consensus, I think, around town and there's,     15:08:13

                 4   I think, some consensus on our panel that        15:08:13

                 5   there are various reasons why it's desirable     15:08:13

                 6   to extend the ISS, if you try and do it          15:08:13

                 7   within this budget, it essentially is the        15:08:13

                 8   budget, other than the other sustaining          15:08:13

                 9   engineering functions of NASA, for the next      15:08:13

                10   decade.                                          15:08:13

                11           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  You know, that's --    15:08:13

                12   you know, that is probably about a third of      15:08:46

                13   the budget actually, although we may have        15:08:46

                14   squashed it and squished it a little bit,        15:08:46

                15   but, you know, it's -- you know, in our          15:08:46

                16   scenarios, if you think of it as about           15:08:46

                17   3 billion a year plus a little bit extra for     15:08:46

                18   transportation.                                  15:08:46

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  So let me be more          15:08:46

                20   precise, which is that the combination of the    15:08:46

                21   keeping alive of the NASA infrastructure and     15:08:46

                22   the operation of the ISS --                      15:08:46

                23           DR. RIDE:  Yes.                          15:08:46

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- essentially eats up     15:08:46

                25   the budget --                                    15:08:46





                                                               104



                 1           DR. RIDE:  Yes.                          15:08:46

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- for the decade.         15:08:46

                 3           DR. RIDE:  Yes.  That's right.           15:09:17

                 4           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Can I footnote that.     15:09:17

                 5   I think I feel as strongly as the other          15:09:17

                 6   members of the group do that technology          15:09:17

                 7   development is critical.  But have we            15:09:17

                 8   increased it so much and so fast that we're      15:09:17

                 9   eating up all of the other options?  I guess     15:09:17

                10   I'm talking about the size, not the              15:09:17

                11   principal.                                       15:09:17

                12           MR. GREASON:  I don't think the thing    15:09:17

                13   that's eating up all of the other options is     15:09:17

                14   the technology budget.                           15:09:17

                15           MR. AUGUSTINE:  No --                    15:09:17

                16           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        15:09:17

                17           MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- but it's helping      15:09:17

                18   it.  If you look at this -- if you cut the       15:09:49

                19   technology budget in half, you still have        15:09:49

                20   three quarters of a billion dollars.             15:09:49

                21           MR. GREASON:  Well, not really.          15:09:49

                22           DR. RIDE:  No.  The line in here         15:09:49

                23   is --                                            15:09:49

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, you've got the     15:09:49

                25   other half up in the ISS, so it's really         15:09:49





                                                               105



                 1   three quarters.                                  15:09:49

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  That's right.  Yeah.  I    15:09:49

                 3   mean, we're only actually -- in this budget      15:09:49

                 4   exercise, only pricing the billion and a half    15:09:49

                 5   dollar technology program at three quarters      15:09:49

                 6   of a million.                                    15:09:49

                 7           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         15:09:49

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  At three quarters of a     15:09:49

                 9   billion.                                         15:09:49

                10           DR. RIDE:  Three quarters of a           15:09:49

                11   billion, right.                                  15:09:49

                12           MR. AUGUSTINE:  But, you know, I         15:09:49

                13   strongly support the point here, but I guess     15:09:49

                14   I'm trying to be the devil's advocate.  If I     15:09:49

                15   were a green eyeshade person, I'd look at        15:09:49

                16   that big blue spot there and say you're goal     15:09:49

                17   watching me here.                                15:10:14

                18           MR. GREASON:  Well, let me frame the     15:10:14

                19   question.  Let me frame the choices -- the       15:10:14

                20   policy choices.  And this is a theme that's      15:10:14

                21   going to recur several times.                    15:10:14

                22           You know, if you don't like what         15:10:14

                23   you're doing -- if you don't like what you're    15:10:14

                24   getting for your money, you can either spend     15:10:14

                25   more money or you can change the price of        15:10:14





                                                               106



                 1   things over time, which is essentially what      15:10:34

                 2   research and development is about, or you can    15:10:34

                 3   turn some other things off, and the other        15:10:34

                 4   things are the other 60 percent of the           15:10:34

                 5   budget, the various fixed costs.  Those are      15:10:34

                 6   your choices.                                    15:10:46

                 7           And so if you don't invest in            15:10:46

                 8   technology and you don't like today's picture    15:10:46

                 9   and you don't turn anything off, then when       15:10:46

                10   the next commission gets up ten years from       15:10:46

                11   now --                                           15:10:55

                12           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I've been there, done    15:10:55

                13   that.                                            15:10:55

                14           MR. GREASON:  -- the situation won't     15:10:55

                15   have changed.                                    15:10:55

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Don't do that to me.     15:10:55

                17           DR. CRAWLEY:  But Jeff is still          15:11:05

                18   young, so...                                     15:11:05

                19           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah, the Greason        15:11:05

                20   commission in 2019.                              15:11:05

                21           Okay.  I give up.                        15:11:09

                22           MR. McALISTER:  Well, but there are      15:11:09

                23   hybrids to each one of these options, of         15:11:09

                24   course, Norm, that you could run.  We picked     15:11:14

                25   these -- or they were picked because they        15:11:14





                                                               107



                 1   were representative differentiationable -- if    15:11:18

                 2   that's a word -- but certainly there's some      15:11:18

                 3   tweaks and hybrids that you could generate on    15:11:19

                 4   a lot of these.                                  15:11:20

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  I just wanted     15:11:22

                 6   to make that point.                              15:11:23

                 7           So, Sally, please...                     15:11:25

                 8           DR. RIDE:  Next slide.  So this is       15:11:26

                 9   fitting the same ISS Focused/Commercial Crew     15:11:29

                10   to LEO to the less constrained budget, and       15:11:32

                11   here you actually can begin to fund the lunar    15:11:36

                12   surface programs.                                15:11:42

                13           Again, we're not saying that this is     15:11:44

                14   exactly how you would run this program, but      15:11:47

                15   we've got a bit of an existence proof here       15:11:48

                16   that at least within this budget, you know,      15:11:51

                17   you can get back to the Moon by, in this         15:11:54

                18   case, 2030.  You get Orion and the heavy         15:11:57

                19   lifter in about 2020 -- 2023.                    15:12:02

                20           As I think, you know, Phil just          15:12:06

                21   mentioned, you know, you can do the mixing       15:12:08

                22   and matching here.  We just kind of matched      15:12:09

                23   this ISS Focused to, you know, kind of a --      15:12:15

                24   almost a program of record, sort of a            15:12:16

                25   lunar -- not program of record but a lunar       15:12:20





                                                               108



                 1   sortie/outpost ending.  If you wanted it to      15:12:25

                 2   be a little bit less expensive and maybe do a    15:12:30

                 3   little bit more in the decade of the '20s,       15:12:30

                 4   you might match it up with the Deep Space        15:12:30

                 5   option, which we'll see is a little bit more     15:12:36

                 6   cost effective.  Okay.  Next one.                15:12:36

                 7           Let's go on to Dash Out of LEO.          15:12:39

                 8           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Sally, before you        15:12:43

                 9   leave ISS -- I'm sorry -- I've got one more.     15:12:43

                10   I'm trying to nail down exactly what the ISS     15:12:47

                11   cost is.                                         15:12:47

                12           On your Chart No. 7, as I do an          15:12:47

                13   optical integration under that, it looks like    15:12:50

                14   it's about 10 billion whereas -- or              15:12:52

                15   9 billion.  We said it was 14-.                  15:12:54

                16           Can we call up Chart 7 and see if        15:12:57

                17   there's something wrong with it or if I just     15:13:00

                18   can't integrate?                                 15:13:03

                19           DR. RIDE:  Which --                      15:13:03

                20           MR. AUGUSTINE:  The difference           15:13:05

                21   between the orange and the green -- there it     15:13:09

                22   is.  The difference between the orange and       15:13:05

                23   the green line looks like it's around            15:13:10

                24   9 billion.                                       15:13:14

                25           DR. CRAWLEY:  This is the difference     15:13:16





                                                               109



                 1   between before and after the 1.5 and the         15:13:16

                 2   difference between then year and constant        15:13:16

                 3   year.                                            15:13:16

                 4           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        15:13:20

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Say that again.          15:13:20

                 6           MR. McALISTER:  In English.              15:13:22

                 7           DR. CRAWLEY:  I'm sorry.  This curve,    15:13:22

                 8   which was drawn some time ago, would have put    15:13:26

                 9   in the factors in un-inflated dollars --         15:13:29

                10           DR. RIDE:  That's right.                 15:13:29

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- and at a minimum,       15:13:34

                12   the one that Sally just showed is in inflated    15:13:35

                13   dollars.                                         15:13:40

                14           MR. AUGUSTINE:  For ISS extension.       15:13:40

                15           DR. CRAWLEY:  And we would have to go    15:13:43

                16   back and look at what historical risk factor     15:13:43

                17   was assigned to the ISS in the out-years.        15:13:46

                18           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         15:13:53

                19           MR. AUGUSTINE:  So we need to update     15:13:53

                20   this chart.                                      15:13:53

                21           MR. GREASON:  No.                        15:13:53

                22           DR. RIDE:  Well, it's a historical       15:13:53

                23   chart.                                           15:13:53

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, the ISS            15:13:53

                25   extension wouldn't be a historical chart.        15:14:00





                                                               110



                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yes.  To be consistent,    15:14:00

                 2   the subsequent data, we would --                 15:14:00

                 3           DR. RIDE:  You know, I think that        15:14:00

                 4   this was probably just done assuming ISS at      15:14:00

                 5   the current kind of very minimal utilization     15:14:09

                 6   level, which I believe that we've agreed         15:14:11

                 7   in --                                            15:14:11

                 8           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Right.                   15:14:11

                 9           DR. RIDE:  -- previous meetings --       15:14:14

                10   is, if you're going to keep running this         15:14:15

                11   thing, you don't want to run it at this -- at    15:14:18

                12   the level where it can't actually do             15:14:20

                13   anything.  You want to increase the              15:14:24

                14   utilization by a few hundred million a year.     15:14:24

                15           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think it's a           15:14:27

                16   poor -- the other numbers, I think, have done    15:14:27

                17   it correctly, right, with the one and a half     15:14:31

                18   and all, but here the situation is much worse    15:14:31

                19   than this summary chart makes it look really.    15:14:35

                20           DR. CRAWLEY:  It's the danger of         15:14:37

                21   trying to show an expense on a budget            15:14:37

                22   chart --                                         15:14:37

                23           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        15:14:37

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- which is what we        15:14:38

                25   tried to do.                                     15:14:38





                                                               111



                 1           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  It's true.             15:14:47

                 2           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, let's update       15:14:47

                 3   that line.                                       15:14:50

                 4           DR. RIDE:  Okay.                         15:14:50

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Got it.  Thank you.      15:14:50

                 6           DR. RIDE:  Okay.  Let's see.  Can we     15:14:50

                 7   go back to...                                    15:15:01

                 8           Thank you.                               15:15:01

                 9           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think you were on      15:15:01

                10   19 or 20.                                        15:15:01

                11           DR. CHIAO:  20, I think.                 15:15:01

                12           MR. AUGUSTINE:  20.                      15:15:01

                13           DR. RIDE:  All right.  Good.  So Dash    15:15:01

                14   Out of LEO was our other hope for matching       15:15:14

                15   the constrained budget -- staying within the     15:15:14

                16   constrained budget.                              15:15:14

                17           The point here was to get to -- get      15:15:14

                18   out of low Earth orbit as soon as possible       15:15:23

                19   and actually make it somewhere.  We used the     15:15:23

                20   Deep Space option as our destination -- set      15:15:29

                21   of destinations.  Again, we've got the           15:15:29

                22   shuttle fly-out in March of 2011, ISS            15:15:32

                23   de-orbit in early 2016.  So all of our money     15:15:39

                24   here is going to exploration as soon as          15:15:43

                25   possible.  And we've moved out the lunar         15:15:43





                                                               112



                 1   surface program a little bit in the future on    15:15:49

                 2   this one.  Next slide.                           15:15:49

                 3           Okay.  So this is what the Dash Out      15:15:55

                 4   of LEO looks like.  And we've actually now       15:16:00

                 5   renamed this, and we have our favorites.         15:16:04

                 6   When we first started the runs, I thought        15:16:09

                 7   that this looked more like a saunter out of      15:16:11

                 8   LEO.  Then as we looked at it more closely,      15:16:15

                 9   it turns out that it's much more of a trudge     15:16:19

                10   out of LEO.  You essentially don't get -- you    15:16:19

                11   know, you just don't get there.                  15:16:21

                12           You know, the message is you get the     15:16:23

                13   heavy-lift vehicle in 2028 but, you know, you    15:16:27

                14   just -- you lose the ability to make it even     15:16:34

                15   to a near Earth orbit, you use the lunar         15:16:37

                16   lander.  So you just -- you know, you thought    15:17:01

                17   you were designing something that would put      15:17:01

                18   all of your efforts on getting out of low        15:17:01

                19   Earth orbit.  But, again, I think here's         15:17:01

                20   where Jeff would make the point that the         15:17:01

                21   fixed costs -- the carrying costs of just --     15:17:01

                22   you know, of the infrastructure that you've      15:17:18

                23   got are kind of killing you and keeping you      15:17:18

                24   from really getting going and developing the     15:17:18

                25   systems that you need.                           15:17:18





                                                               113



                 1           Now, again, we didn't try to optimize    15:17:18

                 2   this.  We've only had time to iterate these a    15:17:18

                 3   certain number of times, but you don't have      15:17:34

                 4   to look too long to say you just would not       15:17:34

                 5   run a program this way, that this budget is      15:17:34

                 6   simply not friendly to exploration.  And it's    15:17:34

                 7   actually very, very difficult to -- as I said    15:17:52

                 8   at the beginning of these, it's very             15:17:52

                 9   difficult to find an exploration scenario        15:17:52

                10   that actually fits within this very              15:17:52

                11   restrictive budget guidance that we've been      15:17:52

                12   given.                                           15:17:52

                13           MR. McALISTER:  And, Sally, for the      15:17:52

                14   public, could you just mention why there's       15:18:05

                15   some dips and some overage on this chart?  I     15:18:05

                16   mean, this one is constrained to the             15:18:05

                17   budget --                                        15:18:05

                18           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         15:18:05

                19           MR. McALISTER:  -- if people are         15:18:05

                20   wondering.                                       15:18:05

                21           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  This is a little       15:18:05

                22   bit -- this was a chart that we could get to     15:18:05

                23   fit a little bit better given one -- given       15:18:23

                24   time to do a little bit more tweaking.  So       15:18:23

                25   the process that goes on here is you first do    15:18:23





                                                               114



                 1   the unconstrained case and then you go in by     15:18:23

                 2   hand and you start moving things around to       15:18:23

                 3   match the peaks and then you do the run again    15:18:23

                 4   and you see where everything falls out.  And     15:18:41

                 5   in some cases, it's relatively easy to match     15:18:41

                 6   perfectly.  In other cases, when you've got      15:18:41

                 7   programs starting and stopping and peaks         15:18:41

                 8   start happening at about the same time, it's     15:18:41

                 9   a little bit harder.  So that's just what's      15:18:41

                10   happening in this case.                          15:18:41

                11           I think it's -- in some cases -- in      15:18:41

                12   fact, this may be the case where -- you see      15:19:01

                13   the -- where it dips below the line actually     15:19:01

                14   twice, there we're kind of building up           15:19:01

                15   reserves in some of the heavy-lift and beyond    15:19:01

                16   LEO programs, because there's not quite          15:19:01

                17   enough money to start them.  And so the          15:19:01

                18   reserves, just in the model, carry over to       15:19:01

                19   the next year until you can use them, and        15:19:26

                20   then they carry over again until the next --     15:19:26

                21   in the next year until you can use them.  And    15:19:26

                22   that's kind of -- I think that that bump         15:19:26

                23   there is actually an artifact of reserves        15:19:26

                24   bumping over.                                    15:19:26

                25           So we could -- you know, we could        15:19:26





                                                               115



                 1   work harder and flatten this one to actually     15:19:26

                 2   constrain to the budget, but, you know, it's     15:19:26

                 3   just not worth the effort.  As I said, you       15:19:26

                 4   would not run your program this way.  You'd      15:19:54

                 5   go back and you'd rethink your whole program     15:19:54

                 6   before you tried to optimize this one.           15:19:54

                 7           MR. BEJMUK:  Sally, does this -- in      15:19:54

                 8   this scenario -- and I think maybe Ed wants      15:19:54

                 9   to answer this.  Are we using dual Ares for      15:19:54

                10   this Dash Out of LEO or a single Ares V Lite?    15:19:54

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  Dual.                      15:19:54

                12           DR. RIDE:  Dual.  Yeah.  It's dual.      15:19:54

                13           MR. BEJMUK:  Why are we using dual?      15:19:54

                14   We don't have a lander, do we?                   15:20:24

                15           DR. RIDE:  But, you know, you choose     15:20:24

                16   your heavy-lift vehicle.                         15:20:24

                17           DR. CRAWLEY:  No.  The rationale here    15:20:24

                18   was to examine how much progress you could       15:20:24

                19   make towards exploration --                      15:20:24

                20           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        15:20:24

                21           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- beyond LEO retiring     15:20:24

                22   the space station at the earliest practical      15:20:24

                23   time and using the simplest systems that you     15:20:24

                24   could use to get out of LEO.                     15:20:24

                25           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        15:20:24





                                                               116



                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  So that we retire the      15:20:24

                 2   space station at '15, we don't build the         15:20:24

                 3   Orion -- the Ares I --                           15:20:45

                 4           DR. RIDE:  That's right.                 15:20:45

                 5           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- and we focus on         15:20:45

                 6   building the Ares V and we don't build the       15:20:45

                 7   lunar surface systems and the lunar lander       15:20:45

                 8   and, instead, we build the -- what's it          15:20:45

                 9   called -- in-space --                            15:20:45

                10           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  The in-space --        15:20:45

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- in-space elements --    15:20:45

                12           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  In-space               15:20:45

                13   elements --                                      15:20:45

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- and we still            15:20:45

                15   don't --                                         15:20:45

                17           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- and we still don't      15:20:45

                18   get anywhere until the end of the next           15:21:12

                19   decade.                                          15:21:12

                20           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        15:21:12

                21           MR. BEJMUK:  Well, do you think --       15:21:12

                22   would your dashing be a little more graceful     15:21:12

                23   if you use a single rocket in this case?         15:21:12

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  We do use a single         15:21:12

                25   rocket.                                          15:21:12

                 1           DR. RIDE:  We do use a single --         15:21:12

                 2           MR. BEJMUK:  Well, that's why I asked    15:21:12

                 3   is it dual --                                    15:21:12

                 4           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yes.                       15:21:12

                 5           MR. BEJMUK:  -- or is it single.         15:21:12

                 6           MR. McALISTER:  It's a dual Ares V       15:21:12

                 7   rocket.  That's what we priced in this one,      15:21:12

                 8   the Ares V rocket.                               15:21:12

                 9           MR. BEJMUK:  Two rockets or one          15:21:12

                10   rocket?                                          15:21:12

                11           MR. McALISTER:  One rocket, two          15:21:12

                12   launches for the mission.                        15:21:12

                13           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         15:21:12

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  No.  Actually we should    15:21:12

                15   be careful that if -- the term is dual Ares V    15:21:12

                16   because it's a dual launch when used for a       15:21:12

                17   lunar piloted mission --                         15:21:12

                18           MR. BEJMUK:  I understand.               15:21:12

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- but actually in         15:21:46

                20   those missions, which don't yet actually         15:21:46

                21   start beginning until just after the curve,      15:21:46

                22   for many of them --                              15:21:46

                23           DR. RIDE:  Just one.                     15:21:46

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- you actually only       15:21:46

                25   use a single launch.                             15:21:46





                                                               118



                 1           MR. BEJMUK:  A single launch?            15:21:46

                 2           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        15:21:46

                 3           MR. BEJMUK:  Thank you.                  15:21:46

                 4           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         15:21:46

                 5           MR. BEJMUK:  That makes sense.           15:21:46

                 6           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Chris, you had a         15:21:46

                 7   question?                                        15:21:46

                 8           DR. CHYBA:  It's really a comment.       15:21:46

                 9   You know, this really looks like a lot like      15:21:46

                10   the program of record fit to the FY '10          15:21:46

                11   budget.  You give up Ares I and you get          15:21:46

                12   technology development beyond LEO capability,    15:21:46

                13   but you get your heavy lift online at the        15:21:46

                14   same time you retire the station.                15:21:46

                15           I mean, it's comforting that the         15:21:46

                16   result is about the same.  To fit within the     15:21:46

                17   FY '10 budget, you don't do anything before      15:22:20

                18   2028.                                            15:22:20

                19           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  And there really is    15:22:20

                20   a consistent message that comes out of these     15:22:20

                21   scenarios.  And, as you said, I mean, it is a    15:22:20

                22   little bit comforting.                           15:22:20

                23           DR. CHYBA:  So to speak.                 15:22:20

                24           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  So to speak.           15:22:20

                25   Interesting choice of words.                     15:22:20





                                                               119



                 1           MR. GREASON:  Consistently bad.          15:22:20

                 2           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  Next slide.            15:22:20

                 3           All right.  So the summary for           15:22:20

                 4   constrained cases, we've already said this,      15:22:20

                 5   but the current budget guidance is very,         15:22:20

                 6   very, very limiting.  And so far we haven't      15:22:20

                 7   found a scenario that includes exploration       15:22:20

                 8   that's viable.  That's not to say that it's      15:22:54

                 9   not out there, but we haven't been able to       15:22:54

                10   find it yet.                                     15:22:54

                11           The ISS Focused, Ares I arrives too      15:22:54

                12   late for the ISS, Commercial Crew to LEO can     15:22:54

                13   support the ISS but the Ares V arrives in        15:22:54

                14   2028 with no lunar surface systems.              15:22:54

                15           The Dash Out of LEO, it isn't -- the     15:22:54

                16   heavy-lift capabilities arrive in 2028, you      15:22:54

                17   know, so you can start doing missions with       15:22:54

                18   one launch, as Bo said, you know, in 2030 or     15:23:24

                19   so.  Next slide.                                 15:23:24

                20           Okay.  So moving on, we're going to      15:23:24

                21   look at the next set, but with that              15:23:24

                22   background, it's very clear that the next set    15:23:24

                23   of options are -- don't have a chance of         15:23:24

                24   fitting into the constrained budget.  They're    15:23:24

                25   going to look only worse than these ones that    15:23:24





                                                               120



                 1   we thought had at least, you know, some          15:23:24

                 2   possibility.  So for all of this next set, we    15:23:54

                 3   looked at the less constrained case, that red    15:23:54

                 4   budget line that I described a little while      15:23:54

                 5   ago.                                             15:23:54

                 6           So the scenarios that we're looking      15:23:54

                 7   at are the Deep Space scenarios.  We've got      15:23:54

                 8   three different variants of this                 15:23:54

                 9   corresponding to three different heavy-lift      15:23:54

                10   options -- Lunar Global, the Use Shuttle         15:23:54

                11   Systems, which is close the gap -- and, Norm,    15:24:21

                12   that's kind of your blue plate special -- and    15:24:21

                13   Mars First.  Next slide.                         15:24:21

                14           So moving into the Deep Space, the       15:24:21

                15   assumptions are pretty much what we've been      15:24:21

                16   seeing -- shuttle fly-out in March 2011, ISS     15:24:21

                17   extended -- and in all of these scenarios,       15:24:43

                18   you'll see that ISS is extended.  We're using    15:24:43

                19   dual Ares Lite vehicles in this.  We've got      15:24:43

                20   the technology development line.  We're using    15:24:43

                21   Commercial Crew to LEO, and our destinations     15:24:43

                22   are Lagrange points, near Earth asteroids,       15:24:43

                23   aiming at flybys -- a Mars flyby.  We've         15:24:57

                24   deferred the lunar lander and lunar systems      15:24:57

                25   in this case, but that's not to say that this    15:24:57





                                                               121



                 1   architecture doesn't allow the lunar lander      15:24:57

                 2   and the lunar systems.  They're just             15:25:16

                 3   deferred.  And we would envision the lunar       15:25:16

                 4   lander and lunar systems being a combination     15:25:16

                 5   of commercial and government.  Next slide.       15:25:16

                 6           This is what this one looks like in      15:25:16

                 7   the less constrained case.  These are            15:25:16

                 8   starting to look a little better.  This is       15:25:16

                 9   the case of the dual Ares V.  You actually       15:25:36

                10   have some destinations in the 2020's.  You       15:25:36

                11   make it to a Lagrange point in 2025, a near      15:25:36

                12   Earth asteroid in 2030.  You can do a Mars       15:25:36

                13   flyby by 2034, and human lunar return            15:25:36

                14   closes -- in this case you can actually do       15:25:53

                15   it -- and you can do that in 2035.               15:25:53

                16           So any questions on this case?  This     15:25:53

                17   just -- you know, you could almost               15:25:53

                18   undoubtedly do some optimization around any      15:26:04

                19   of these, but with the dual Ares V, this is      15:26:04

                20   what this -- and this budget on the order of     15:26:04

                21   3 billion a year above the budget guidance --    15:26:11

                22   ramping up to that but on that order in the      15:26:16

                23   out-years, this is what you can achieve.         15:26:16

                24           MR. GREASON:  Sally?                     15:26:22

                25           DR. RIDE:  Yes.                          15:26:22





                                                               122



                 1           MR. GREASON:  Since I haven't seen       15:26:23

                 2   the adjusted manifest for this yet, do you       15:26:25

                 3   have some idea of kind of what's the pace of     15:26:28

                 4   missions?  I mean, are you doing a mission       15:26:28

                 5   every other year or every third year?            15:26:32

                 6           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  I think it actually    15:26:35

                 7   comes out to about every other year.  It         15:26:35

                 8   depends a little bit on the missions, as you     15:26:40

                 9   know.  I haven't seen how the -- I haven't       15:26:44

                10   seen the detailed manifest yet, but it's --      15:26:44

                11   you know, once you get going, you can roughly    15:26:55

                12   follow the manifest.  Next slide.                15:26:55

                13           Now we're moving on to the directly      15:27:04

                14   shuttle-derived heavy-lift vehicle.  This is     15:27:08

                15   about a 100-metric-ton vehicle, and we're        15:27:10

                16   using the shuttle-derived vehicle for cargo      15:27:16

                17   only.  We're still using Commercial Crew to      15:27:19

                18   LEO for any scenarios that would use a crew      15:27:23

                19   capsule.  They would presumably be using the     15:27:27

                20   Orion, and we'd be launching it with no          15:27:32

                21   people on and then the people would be added     15:27:35

                22   in space.  Technology development line.  Next    15:27:40

                24           This is what this one looks like.        15:27:42

                25   The shuttle-derived vehicle is a little bit      15:27:47

                 1   more cost effective primarily because it's       15:27:52

                 2   using the existing infrastructure and it's       15:27:55

                 3   pretty well known.  Get to Lagrange points in    15:28:00

                 4   2023.  That's a couple of years sooner.  Near    15:28:03

                 5   Earth asteroids or objects in 2027, a few        15:28:09

                 6   years sooner.  Mars flyby in 2029.  Human        15:28:14

                 7   lunar return in 2030.  Next slide.               15:28:17

                 8           Okay.  Now we're moving on to the        15:28:24

                 9   case of a commercial buy, and this is to be      15:28:28

                10   representative of a commercial large -- call     15:28:33

                11   it 75-metric-ton hydrocarbon booster.  So all    15:28:37

                12   of the assumptions are the same except the       15:28:43

                13   booster is different.  That, for some of the     15:28:46

                14   destinations, requires additional launches.      15:28:53

                15   We've covered that in the manifesting in the     15:28:58

                16   scenarios.  Next slide.                          15:28:58

                17           Okay.  The thing to say about this       15:29:05

                18   slide is that it brings in considerable          15:29:05

                19   efficiencies, because you're doing business a    15:29:11

                20   new way.  You're actually -- you're making a     15:29:19

                21   commercial buy out of your heavy-lift            15:29:19

                22   vehicle.  You can see that there's               15:29:25

                23   actually -- once you get -- once you get ISS     15:29:25

                24   retired, you've actually got quite a nice        15:29:30

                25   little dip there below the budget, and then      15:29:32





                                                               124



                 1   it kind of ramps up as you're going into         15:29:35

                 2   significant operations.                          15:29:39

                 3           But if you just look at these, you       15:29:40

                 4   know, you get to Lagrange points by 2024;        15:29:44

                 5   near Earth objects, 2026; Mars flyby, 2028       15:29:49

                 6   and then human lunar return, 2029.               15:29:56

                 7           Now, it's important here to talk         15:30:02

                 8   about the disruptions that occur in the          15:30:02

                 9   effort to get to those efficiencies.  So this    15:30:07

                10   is a significantly different way of doing        15:30:13

                11   business for NASA, and it would significantly    15:30:13

                12   disrupt the NASA workforce and the NASA          15:30:17

                13   infrastructure.  It would require dismantling    15:30:20

                14   a not insignificant part of the                  15:30:25

                15   infrastructure that we've built up over the      15:30:31

                16   decades at Kennedy Space Center, at Michoud,     15:30:31

                17   at our engine test facilities.                   15:30:37

                18           So notice the yellow highlighting        15:30:37

                19   right in the middle of the graph that says       15:30:43

                20   $3 billion for facility shutdown costs.  We      15:30:43

                21   spent a lot of time discussing how to take       15:30:48

                22   into account the costs associated with this      15:30:52

                23   disruption.  So it's everything from closing     15:30:58

                24   down facilities at some ramp-down,               15:30:58

                25   mothballing facilities, safing facilities, to    15:31:03





                                                               125



                 1   reducing the civil service workforce by          15:31:07

                 2   actually, in this case, 3,000 people.  So        15:31:11

                 3   this is not an insignificant change.             15:31:15

                 4           Even at midnight last night, there       15:31:19

                 5   was a lot of discussion and calculations         15:31:21

                 6   going on between the NASA folks and the          15:31:24

                 7   Aerospace folks -- primarily the NASA            15:31:33

                 8   folks -- just trying to get a handle on the      15:31:33

                 9   data and interacting actually with Jeff and      15:31:37

                10   with me to try to come up with kind of a         15:31:37

                11   bound of what these costs are.  So we            15:31:42

                12   actually have not come to a conclusion yet.      15:31:50

                13   The NASA folks, even amongst themselves, have    15:31:50

                14   not determined what they think these costs       15:31:57

                15   should be.  So we're still a ways off.  This     15:31:57

                16   is not an easy problem to figure this out.       15:32:03

                17           So we've actually got a bound, and       15:32:03

                18   it's not a small range.  We've got this chart    15:32:09

                19   at a $3 billion facilities closure and           15:32:09

                20   workforce reduction cost.  The next chart        15:32:17

                21   shows an $11 billion facilities closing and      15:32:17

                22   workforce reduction cost taken over the          15:32:25

                23   period of around six years.  So why don't we     15:32:25

                24   go to the next chart that shows the effect of    15:32:29

                25   that.                                            15:32:29





                                                               126



                 1           This -- you can see that that            15:32:33

                 2   wedge -- I think it's the yellow -- light --     15:32:33

                 3   very pale yellow wedge that shows up there       15:32:37

                 4   right after the shuttle wedge.  So that's        15:32:42

                 5   kind of how it plays out.  So it's not a         15:32:46

                 6   small part of this thing.                        15:32:48

                 7           You still get to the savings.  You       15:32:50

                 8   get to them a little bit later.  And it's --     15:32:52

                 9   you know, it's not quite as deep once you get    15:32:58

                10   there because you've got to be kind of making    15:32:58

                11   up time, but you do get to the savings in the    15:33:04

                12   out-years.                                       15:33:04

                13           It does -- this does push things out     15:33:11

                14   a little bit.  The first Lagrange point is       15:33:11

                15   2025; first NEO is 2027; Mars flyby, 2029;       15:33:11

                16   human lunar return, 2030.                        15:33:21

                17           So we think with these two cases that    15:33:24

                18   we've bounded the closure costs and the          15:33:32

                19   disruption, but it is -- you know, you           15:33:32

                20   shouldn't underestimate the magnitude of the     15:33:32

                21   repercussions on this one because it's very      15:33:41

                22   difficult to reduce the civil service            15:33:41

                23   workforce by 3,000 over, you know, a period      15:33:48

                24   of time like this.                               15:33:48

                25           DR. CHIAO:  Sally, can I ask a           15:33:48





                                                               127



                 1   question?  Maybe it's more for Ed, but for       15:33:53

                 2   both of you.                                     15:33:53

                 3           I'm just thinking here, if in this --    15:33:53

                 4   like in this scenario, the Orion and RP          15:33:53

                 5   booster, is that launching unmanned and then     15:33:58

                 6   the commercial transport rendezvouses and        15:33:58

                 7   docks with it?                                   15:34:03

                 8           DR. RIDE:  Uh-huh.                       15:34:03

                 9           DR. CHIAO:  I guess in all of these      15:34:03

                10   scenarios where we're doing that kind of         15:34:07

                11   thing -- especially where we're doing that       15:34:07

                12   kind of thing, it begs the question do we        15:34:07

                13   need the Orion.                                  15:34:07

                14           MR. GREASON:  Well, that leads           15:34:12

                15   actually to a point I wanted to raise.           15:34:15

                16   There's a whole bunch of things I want to say    15:34:18

                17   about this, and I'll save some of them for       15:34:20

                18   later in the discussion.                         15:34:24

                19           But one of them is, you know, the        15:34:25

                20   least worse scenario that I have been able to    15:34:27

                21   spot in terms of fitting to something least      15:34:30

                22   far away from the President's guidance budget    15:34:35

                23   that still does exploration would be to do       15:34:37

                24   this and take the bitter pill -- and it's a      15:34:40

                25   better pill -- of radical change in the way      15:34:45





                                                               128



                 1   that we do business -- and take two and call     15:34:48

                 2   me in the morning -- and to also cancel          15:34:53

                 3   Orion, which would allow you to re-scope the     15:34:56

                 4   size and mass of the capsule in a future         15:34:57

                 5   procurement to more closely match the            15:35:01

                 6   transportation infrastructure that you're        15:35:05

                 7   building up, and then you would delay the        15:35:07

                 8   acquisition of whatever your beyond LEO          15:35:09

                 9   capsules is until after the commercial crew      15:35:13

                10   taxi capsules had entered service so you had     15:35:16

                11   a different industrial base in the future        15:35:20

                12   than you have today of people who have that      15:35:23

                13   recent experience doing those kind of            15:35:26

                14   capsules.  So it's kind of like you go from      15:35:27

                15   Mercury to Gemini.  You would get a chance to    15:35:27

                16   employ lessons learned and try it over again.    15:35:30

                17           If you did that -- well -- and that's    15:35:33

                18   one factor.  And then the other factor is        15:35:36

                19   this double bump appearance.  This double        15:35:41

                20   bump appearance is a product of a                15:35:43

                21   considerable amount of ignorance that we've      15:35:48

                22   got about what would the future in the           15:35:48

                23   2025-plus time frame look like, and nobody on    15:35:52

                24   the planet knows that.                           15:35:56

                25           In some sense, the point of              15:35:58





                                                               129



                 1   purchasing these elements more commercially      15:36:01

                 2   is to enable there to be innovation and          15:36:04

                 3   competition among multiple providers.  And       15:36:07

                 4   yet when we are faced with the prospect of       15:36:09

                 5   how to cost these things, we have no way to      15:36:11

                 6   account for that.                                15:36:14

                 7           So this second bump in the 2025-plus     15:36:16

                 8   time frame is of different character than the    15:36:19

                 9   high out-year costs and all of the other         15:36:22

                10   scenarios.  This is actually going to the        15:36:24

                11   purchasing of incremental costs of more          15:36:26

                12   flying hardware.  In other words, you can        15:36:28

                13   turn this wick up and down in this scenario,     15:36:33

                14   which you essentially you can't do on all of     15:36:36

                15   the other scenarios because they're all fixed    15:36:39

                16   costs and this one is dominated by               15:36:39

                17   incremental costs.  So -- and the incremental    15:36:44

                18   costs are the ones that we're hoping will        15:36:48

                19   come down over time, but we have no idea by      15:36:48

                20   how much.                                        15:36:52

                21           So there is a chance -- by no means a    15:36:52

                22   certainty -- and insert Bo's speech, which I     15:36:55

                23   completely agree with, about this is a huge      15:36:55

                24   radical change in doing business, it's a leap    15:36:59

                25   into the unknown.  But there is a chance that    15:37:00





                                                               130



                 1   if you took that set of steps you'd have         15:37:03

                 2   something that was somewhere between the         15:37:07

                 3   President's guidance and the higher number       15:37:09

                 4   that we're talking about.  It still wouldn't     15:37:12

                 5   fall all of the way back down to the line,       15:37:15

                 6   but it might not be as far above it.             15:37:17

                 7           MR. BEJMUK:  Sally, you know, this       15:37:25

                 8   whole wonderful idea of how to save money by     15:37:29

                 9   changing direction -- you know, there's a new    15:37:33

                10   deal, new direction, new way of doing            15:37:35

                11   business -- you know, it sounds good, you        15:37:38

                12   know, and I'm sure that the older you are the    15:37:39

                13   more of these turns you have lived through.      15:37:42

                14   Let me just say to you all, how would we do      15:37:49

                15   this.                                            15:37:49

                16           So you actually destroy part of NASA,    15:37:52

                17   you give it to the guys who today participate    15:37:54

                18   in mission assurance and also provide            15:37:54

                19   independent savvy to contractors -- and I was    15:38:00

                20   contractors and I used to have NASA guys,        15:38:03

                21   smart guys, looking over my shoulders to make    15:38:06

                22   sure that I don't goof up and, God know, I       15:38:10

                23   did enough of that.  So you'd like to get rid    15:38:11

                24   of it.  So you would -- so that scenario         15:38:14

                25   would get rid of that.                           15:38:16





                                                               131



                 1           You would abandon what we do well --     15:38:18

                 2   what we have developed doing well over           15:38:21

                 3   several decades and learn what Russians have     15:38:21

                 4   done well or buy their product, you know, in     15:38:25

                 5   terms of propulsion, and more importantly --     15:38:29

                 6   most importantly, NASA really doesn't build      15:38:35

                 7   things.  NASA buys things.  On these major       15:38:37

                 8   programs typically NASA spends in-house about    15:38:41

                 9   20 percent.  They buy from contractors about     15:38:43

                10   80 percent.                                      15:38:46

                11           And somehow you take -- you beat up      15:38:47

                12   NASA, you push them back, you say you guys go    15:38:51

                13   and do something else or get laid off -- and,    15:38:54

                14   you know, I -- and turn it over to the guys      15:38:57

                15   who take -- today provide 80 percent, you        15:39:02

                16   know, of services and goods for NASA budget      15:39:02

                17   and somehow out of that you're supposed to       15:39:06

                18   come with this huge savings.  And I think it     15:39:13

                19   just violates common sense, in my mind.          15:39:13

                20           I think what's going to happen is        15:39:24

                21   we'll create havoc that will probably last --    15:39:24

                22   I don't know -- five years, ten years.  You      15:39:24

                23   know, there will be -- NASA is not, by the       15:39:24

                24   way, very easily directable.  I've been          15:39:37

                25   interacting -- I've been NASA's contractor       15:39:37





                                                               132



                 1   forever.  So they'll fight in the end and        15:39:37

                 2   that flight will create a lot of instability,    15:39:37

                 3   havoc, and when the dust is finally              15:39:37

                 4   settled -- it could be a decade later -- we      15:39:52

                 5   will wonder what have we done.                   15:39:52

                 6           And Norm said something today which      15:39:52

                 7   was very wise, and I clearly agree with it.      15:39:52

                 8   Stability is important.  You know, small         15:39:52

                 9   deviations from your direction are tolerable.    15:40:04

                10   You know, if we think that NASA has too much     15:40:04

                11   infrastructure, we ought to make a strong        15:40:04

                12   recommendation to NASA -- reduce your            15:40:04

                13   infrastructure, be a little more effective,      15:40:04

                14   efficient.                                       15:40:15

                15           But saying we are going to do this by    15:40:15

                16   telling them -- well, first of all, we don't     15:40:15

                17   tell anybody anything.  We provide options.      15:40:15

                18   But providing an option which -- which           15:40:15

                19   somebody may think this is actually a pretty     15:40:21

                20   good idea, get NASA out of this business,        15:40:21

                21   create this situation and hope that at the       15:40:26

                22   end you will be doing business at lower          15:40:26

                23   costs.                                           15:40:31

                24           And even you guys use this word          15:40:31

                25   chance.  Do you really want to provide an        15:40:31





                                                               133



                 1   option that will leave the future of America     15:40:36

                 2   in space to chance?  I don't know.  I've got     15:40:40

                 3   a little problem with that.                      15:40:40

                 4           MR. GREASON:  Unless more money          15:40:46

                 5   comes, we don't have a chance, we have a         15:40:46

                 6   certainty and the certainty is not good.         15:40:49

                 7           MR. BEJMUK:  If the problem is money,    15:40:52

                 8   let's try to figure out how to help NASA get     15:40:52

                 9   more money.  You know, let's look at the root    15:40:58

                10   cause and not sort of try to work on the side    15:41:00

                11   to allow then addressing the root cause.         15:41:03

                12           In fact, I think what Sally              15:41:09

                13   presented -- this, you know, slightly            15:41:09

                14   increase funding of it 3 billion per year,       15:41:11

                15   that does miracles to these charts -- several    15:41:13

                16   of them -- a hell of a lot better -- excuse      15:41:17

                17   me my language -- by suggesting that maybe       15:41:21

                18   the country ought to spend an additional         15:41:23

                19   3 million for -- billion for NASA programs.      15:41:23

                20           But I think we ought to address what     15:41:26

                21   problem we are solving.  If it's a -- if it's    15:41:30

                22   money, well, let's address money.  If it's       15:41:30

                23   NASA inefficiency or too big an                  15:41:33

                24   infrastructure, let's address that but not       15:41:39

                25   say let's scramble what we have done well,       15:41:41

                 1   get ourselves on these new set of tracks and     15:41:43

                 2   take the chance that we'll be successful.        15:41:48

                 3   That's all.                                      15:41:51

                 4           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  Chris, do you     15:41:52

                 5   want to follow that?                             15:41:57

                 6           DR. CHYBA:  This comment may be          15:41:57

                 7   better placed at the end of Sally's              15:41:59

                 8   presentation, but I'll toss it in now            15:41:59

                 9   inspired by Bo's remarks.                        15:42:04

                10           I think one thing I'm taking from        15:42:04

                11   this is the importance of the question Norm      15:42:08

                12   asked earlier about what actually is the         15:42:08

                13   integrated shuttle fly-out cost from 2015 to     15:42:13

                14   2020 including, I guess, de-orbiting at the      15:42:18

                15   end of that.                                     15:42:18

                16           The scenarios that at least have us      15:42:18

                17   doing something in the '20s are these less       15:42:28

                18   constrained scenarios that come in at budget     15:42:28

                19   that are 23- or $25 billion over the budget      15:42:28

                20   guidance, and it looks to me like station        15:42:35

                21   with this 1.2 multiplier actually accounts       15:42:35

                22   for the majority of that addition -- the         15:42:41

                23   station fly-out from 2015 to 2020.               15:42:41

                24           Although politics is certainly beyond    15:42:47

                25   our competence or job description, there's       15:42:47





                                                               135



                 1   clearly going to be, I think, a strong           15:42:51

                 2   political constituency for not dropping          15:42:54

                 3   station into the ocean in 2016.  And one         15:42:54

                 4   could imagine an understanding in which you      15:42:57

                 5   extend station as an above the budget --         15:43:02

                 6   above the budget line, and that might really     15:43:07

                 7   account for most of this additional budget       15:43:07

                 8   that would have to be found.                     15:43:10

                 9           So I think just knowing what that        15:43:14

                10   number was -- and you obviously have the         15:43:14

                11   data --                                          15:43:20

                12           DR. RIDE:  We do.                        15:43:20

                13           DR. CHYBA:  -- it would be very good     15:43:20

                14   to know that number.                             15:43:20

                15           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  In fact, we            15:43:20

                16   actually -- that data is in the backup detail    15:43:20

                17   that goes with these that, you know, just        15:43:28

                18   arrived at, you know, 4:00 in the morning        15:43:28

                19   and, you know, our eyes were too bleary to be    15:43:33

                20   able to focus on those small line numbers.       15:43:39

                21   But we've got the data.                          15:43:39

                22           DR. CRAWLEY:  Sally, just different      15:43:43

                23   way of expressing some concern about the         15:43:45

                24   optimism expressed by this chart is that, as     15:43:47

                25   we're flipping -- as I flip through these,       15:43:51





                                                               136



                 1   this is sort of one of the better looking        15:43:51

                 2   ones if I -- the less constrained Deep Space,    15:43:53

                 3   right -- one of the better looking ones, and     15:43:56

                 4   yet as you look at the buildup of costs in       15:43:59

                 5   this one, it's the one based on, in some         15:44:01

                 6   sense, the largest number of notional            15:44:05

                 7   systems.                                         15:44:10

                 8           And, you know, another truism is that    15:44:10

                 9   early in the scoping of a system one tends to    15:44:14

                10   be more optimistic about its eventual costs      15:44:16

                11   than one is as one gains more experience with    15:44:21

                12   it.  So, you know, it's the paper rocket         15:44:25

                13   versus the real rocket problem reflected here    15:44:26

                14   in almost every line.  I'm not saying it         15:44:27

                15   isn't right.                                     15:44:32

                16           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         15:44:32

                17           DR. CRAWLEY:  But, you know, you         15:44:34

                18   would have more uncertainty about these costs    15:44:34

                19   than in some of the other charts we've seen.     15:44:38

                20           DR. RIDE:  I think that's a -- I         15:44:42

                21   think that's fair.  I think there's also an      15:44:44

                22   enormous amount of uncertainty actually in       15:44:45

                23   all of the charts.                               15:44:52

                24           Because once you get past Orion,         15:44:52

                25   which we have a reasonable understanding of,     15:44:52





                                                               137



                 1   Ares I, which we have a reasonable               15:44:55

                 2   understanding of, Ares V, now Lite, which        15:44:58

                 3   is -- we don't have quite as good an             15:45:02

                 4   understanding of as Ares V, but we don't have    15:45:06

                 5   very good understanding frankly of Altair,       15:45:11

                 6   you know, or any of the systems.                 15:45:14

                 7           So all of these charts suffer from       15:45:17

                 8   the problem that once you get out past -- you    15:45:17

                 9   know, you choose your favorite date, whether     15:45:23

                10   it's 2015 or 2020 -- there's a lot of is it      15:45:27

                11   fiction or is it uncertainty, and it's true      15:45:27

                12   in all of the charts.  And I think that, as      15:45:31

                13   you said, we tried to level the playing          15:45:38

                14   field, and I think that once you get out to      15:45:38

                15   the mid -- the '20s it's really hard to          15:45:47

                16   distinguish which ones there's more fiction      15:45:47

                17   in or more uncertainty in than others.           15:45:53

                18           I actually agree that there is less      15:45:57

                19   certainty with some of these scenarios than      15:46:01

                20   others, but I think that we're really fooling    15:46:04

                21   ourselves if we think that there's certainty     15:46:06

                22   with any of them.                                15:46:08

                23           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, I mean, I think      15:46:11

                24   that's an excellent sort of commentary on the    15:46:13

                25   whole process that we have to -- nobody in       15:46:15





                                                               138



                 1   this committee -- I'm sure I already know --     15:46:17

                 2   and nobody who's looking at these charts         15:46:19

                 3   today should view them as actual budget          15:46:21

                 4   charts.                                          15:46:26

                 5           DR. RIDE:  That's exactly right.         15:46:26

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  I mean, they're sort of    15:46:29

                 7   examinations of what might occur in a budget     15:46:32

                 8   as a first order sensitivity.  And that's the    15:46:34

                 9   way, I think it's clear, that we're viewing      15:46:37

                10   them, and that's the way, it's clear, that       15:46:41

                11   anyone else looking at them should be viewing    15:46:44

                12   them.                                            15:46:47

                13           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  I'd say it even        15:46:47

                14   more strongly than that.  You know, this         15:46:47

                15   methodology and the process that we're going     15:46:51

                16   through, it's actually a very good process,      15:46:51

                17   and it's very good methodology.  And we've       15:46:51

                18   had very, very good people from both             15:46:55

                19   Aerospace and NASA who have been working very    15:46:58

                20   hard trying to make it as good as they can.      15:47:01

                21           Having said that, each run that you      15:47:03

                22   do, you get smarter, and each run that you do    15:47:07

                23   requires putting some intelligence into the      15:47:10

                24   next run.  And until you get to the point        15:47:13

                25   where you've done four or five or six runs,      15:47:17





                                                               139



                 1   even with a given scenario, you haven't kind     15:47:21

                 2   of leveled out at a good understanding of how    15:47:21

                 3   the interactions in that scenario work.          15:47:24

                 4   We're -- at best, we've done two to three        15:47:29

                 5   runs of these scenarios.  Some of them we        15:47:32

                 6   haven't even finished the less constrained       15:47:36

                 7   budget runs.                                     15:47:38

                 8           I mean, you're going to see that I'm     15:47:41

                 9   just about out of the sand charts because we     15:47:44

                10   ran out of time.  At, you know, 12:45 today      15:47:47

                11   the last chart came in, and, you know, there     15:47:50

                12   are two that we haven't got.  So what that       15:47:52

                13   speaks to is that we are right in the middle     15:47:55

                14   of actually still the learning curve even in     15:47:59

                15   doing the best job that we could in              15:48:02

                16   optimizing these scenarios.                      15:48:05

                17           Having said that, though, I think        15:48:08

                18   that we've learned an awful lot just from the    15:48:11

                19   process that we've been through and there are    15:48:14

                20   a lot of things that are starting to pop out     15:48:15

                21   and there's not value in running each of         15:48:18

                22   these scenarios ten times and trying to, you     15:48:22

                23   know, get it down to the finest decimal point    15:48:25

                24   you can.  That's not the point of this           15:48:30

                25   exercise.                                        15:48:34





                                                               140



                 1           The point of this exercise is to try     15:48:34

                 2   to understand which of these scenarios have a    15:48:39

                 3   chance of fitting under -- within particular     15:48:39

                 4   budgetary guidelines and which pieces of the     15:48:44

                 5   scenarios actually give you either the most      15:48:44

                 6   capability or the best -- the cost               15:48:49

                 7   effectiveness and being able to then say,        15:48:55

                 8   okay, well, had we been smarter, like we are     15:48:55

                 9   now, we might have taken this vehicle to         15:49:01

                10   match it with this scenario.                     15:49:01

                11           And we've done a little bit of that.     15:49:01

                12   The Deep Space attempt was actually an           15:49:07

                13   attempt to try to get a look at the              15:49:07

                14   sensitivity to the different launch vehicle      15:49:13

                15   options -- the heavy-lift options.  That's       15:49:13

                16   why we ran this one with the three different     15:49:20

                17   launch vehicles.  But, you know, there's         15:49:20

                18   plenty to still be learned from this in the      15:49:20

                19   mixing and matching, and I don't want to         15:49:26

                20   overstate the level of maturity of any of        15:49:26

                21   these.                                           15:49:37

                22           MR. AUGUSTINE:  You know, I'd like to    15:49:37

                23   make two points.                                 15:49:37

                24           One is that our objective today is to    15:49:37

                25   define options and the costs will turn out to    15:49:37





                                                               141



                 1   be what the costs turn out to be.                15:49:37

                 2           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        15:49:37

                 3           MR. AUGUSTINE:  So if we can agree on    15:49:47

                 4   costs -- excuse me.  If we can agree on the      15:49:47

                 5   options today, then we're supposed to have       15:49:47

                 6   another 20 percent of our 90 days to make the    15:49:47

                 7   costs even more accurate.                        15:49:47

                 8           Second observation is:  If you change    15:49:57

                 9   the cost by 20 percent plus or minus, it         15:49:57

                10   doesn't change any of the answers that we've     15:49:57

                11   talked about so far.  So, you know --            15:50:09

                12           MR. GREASON:  Well, I don't agree        15:50:09

                13   with that.                                       15:50:09

                14           MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- there's no            15:50:09

                15   overwhelming --                                  15:50:09

                16           DR. CHYBA:  If the 20 percent goes       15:50:09

                17   the right way.                                   15:50:09

                18           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         15:50:09

                19           MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- issues here on        15:50:09

                20   that.                                            15:50:09

                21           MR. GREASON:  I still think when you     15:50:09

                22   wade through all of the numbers, you know,       15:50:20

                23   you've got a handful of overarching issues       15:50:20

                24   that come out, you know, and this chart is       15:50:20

                25   always the controversial one, not because of     15:50:20





                                                               142



                 1   the technical details but because surface is     15:50:33

                 2   one of the controversial issues.  You know,      15:50:33

                 3   your choices are spend more, do less, or do      15:50:33

                 4   something radically different.  And do           15:50:33

                 5   something radically different is cut the         15:50:44

                 6   fixed costs and deal with the pain.              15:50:44

                 7           And, you know, the reason groups like    15:50:44

                 8   this have such a varied composition is           15:50:44

                 9   there's all of those people who have, you        15:50:55

                10   know, seen everything and know all of the        15:50:55

                11   reasons why nothing can ever be changed and      15:50:55

                12   there's, you know, idiots like me coming in      15:50:55

                13   who haven't seen all of that stuff yet --        15:50:55

                14   but, you know, I lived through the transition    15:51:03

                15   of the computer industry from when everything    15:51:03

                16   came on Big Iron to when everything sat on       15:51:03

                17   your desk, and some of you have lived through    15:51:03

                18   the transition of the defense industry at the    15:51:07

                19   end of the Cold War.                             15:51:09

                20           And you actually can change what the     15:51:11

                21   fixed costs are.  It's not fun.  It's not        15:51:16

                22   easy.  But you actually -- it's also not         15:51:19

                23   axiomatically impossible.                        15:51:25

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Also you mentioned       15:51:27

                25   three options.  There's a fourth option,         15:51:27





                                                               143



                 1   which is to do some of each or at least some     15:51:32

                 2   of two of the things that you said, and that     15:51:32

                 3   probably is doable.                              15:51:35

                 4           I suspect NASA is not as efficient as    15:51:38

                 5   it might be by a fair amount.  And I also        15:51:42

                 6   suspect that if we are going to have a really    15:51:46

                 7   strong space program in this country, a Human    15:51:50

                 8   Space Flight program, we may have to face to     15:51:55

                 9   investing more -- face up to investing more      15:51:55

                10   in it.  I think that's -- but that's why         15:51:57

                11   we're putting together options and we have a     15:52:06

                12   President to make decisions.                     15:52:06

                13           Sally, why don't we let you go ahead.    15:52:06

                14           DR. RIDE:  Okay.  How about the next     15:52:19

                15   chart.                                           15:52:19

                16           I think we've got one chart on the       15:52:19

                17   Lunar Global scenario.  This also has ISS        15:52:19

                18   extension to 2020.  It also has a Commercial     15:52:19

                19   Crew to LEO.  The heavy lifter is the Ares V     15:52:33

                20   dual.  It's the Lite.  The technology            15:52:33

                21   development line, and I think -- well, why       15:52:33

                22   don't we just go on the next chart here.         15:52:48

                23           This is one that came in latest, and     15:52:48

                24   they haven't yet been able to do the             15:52:48

                25   iterations to fit this.  This one still looks    15:52:48





                                                               144



                 1   a little bit suspicious to me, you know, and     15:53:01

                 2   so I think that this is a good -- almost an      15:53:01

                 3   example of what we've been doing over the        15:53:01

                 4   last few days of saying, okay, that looks        15:53:01

                 5   good but it looks -- but some of the elements    15:53:10

                 6   look like they might not be as well specified    15:53:10

                 7   as they should be.                               15:53:10

                 8           So we haven't had any time with this     15:53:16

                 9   one, but this gives you just a sense of the      15:53:16

                10   status of the process to date.  So this one      15:53:23

                11   is also going to get you something.              15:53:23

                12           We were running these cases both with    15:53:28

                13   the Ares V dual and with the commercial buy      15:53:33

                14   option, again, just to see the sensitivity to    15:53:33

                15   the two ways of doing business to be able to     15:53:37

                16   give the committee some options to think         15:53:42

                17   about.  Next slide.                              15:53:46

                18           The U.S. Shuttle Systems, we actually    15:53:46

                19   have not got this chart yet.  We have been       15:53:46

                20   through the unconstrained version, and we        15:53:57

                21   just ran out of time.  So people are probably    15:53:57

                22   sitting off -- trying to finish off this run     15:54:04

                23   right now, but we don't have this one.           15:54:07

                24           This case was extend the shuttle at      15:54:07

                25   the minimum flight rate.  Norm, as I said,       15:54:11





                                                               145



                 1   this was kind of your blue plate special.  We    15:54:14

                 2   close the gap.  We extend ISS to 2020.  We       15:54:14

                 3   use Commercial Crew to LEO.  This is the case    15:54:17

                 4   where we said:  If you're going to extend the    15:54:24

                 5   shuttle, then it really does only make sense     15:54:26

                 6   to do that if you use the shuttle-derived        15:54:30

                 7   heavy lift.                                      15:54:33

                 8           As somebody mentioned earlier, you       15:54:33

                 9   can also run the argument backwards.  It's       15:54:35

                10   not as strong an argument, but even if you       15:54:37

                11   retire the shuttle, there is some potential      15:54:41

                12   value in using all of that infrastructure and    15:54:44

                13   expertise and just -- and existing workforce     15:54:49

                14   and facilities to build a directly               15:54:49

                15   shuttle-derived heavy-lift vehicle.  Next        15:54:53

                16   slide.                                           15:54:53

                17           I think we don't have a chart for        15:54:59

                18   that one.                                        15:55:01

                19           Mars Direct, as we were sorting out      15:55:06

                20   these scenarios and giving priorities to         15:55:09

                21   Aerospace and NASA to do the costing and to      15:55:14

                22   do the computer runs, we realized that this      15:55:17

                23   one had quite a bit higher costs than some of    15:55:22

                24   the other scenarios.  Just the results that      15:55:29

                25   we were seeing from some of the others, it       15:55:29





                                                               146



                 1   was pretty clear that this one was going to      15:55:29

                 2   be very, very difficult to fit even into our     15:55:29

                 3   constrained budget.  So we asked them to get     15:55:37

                 4   to this run last of the runs, and this one is    15:55:37

                 5   still on the list.  We haven't even seen the     15:55:47

                 6   unconstrained budget of this.                    15:55:47

                 7           I think what is true, though, just       15:55:47

                 8   given what we've seen so far, is that a          15:55:47

                 9   likely approach under the sort of budgets        15:55:59

                10   that we're talking about for a                   15:55:59

                11   Mars First/Mars Direct would be to focus hard    15:55:59

                12   on robust technology development so that you     15:55:59

                13   could improve your capabilities and make it      15:56:08

                14   much more feasible to go to Mars in a            15:56:08

                15   different way in the future.  Next slide.        15:56:08

                16           How about the next -- see if we          15:56:08

                17   actually have a summary.  There we go.           15:56:08

                18           You know, so I think it is what it       15:56:16

                19   is, we are where we are.  There's more work      15:56:16

                20   to be done in developing the costing, but I      15:56:18

                21   think the more important thing is the work       15:56:21

                22   that needs to be done in figuring out --         15:56:26

                23   Norm, just as you said -- the scenarios that     15:56:29

                24   we want to focus on in the next round of         15:56:31

                25   this.                                            15:56:33





                                                               147



                 1           The important components, we really      15:56:33

                 2   feel strongly about the technology program,      15:56:37

                 3   we feel strongly about the commercial crew       15:56:40

                 4   capability to get to LEO.  That was one thing    15:56:42

                 5   that fell out of these runs, that the            15:56:48

                 6   Ares I/Orion option was much less attractive     15:56:51

                 7   than the commercial crew capability to LEO --    15:56:55

                 8   and, again, properly motivated and               15:56:57

                 9   incentivized.  So the 2.5 billion is to          15:57:05

                10   encourage a wide variety of competitors.         15:57:13

                11           Exploration --                           15:57:16

                12           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Before you leave         15:57:16

                13   that, Sally, the data that we saw in             15:57:18

                14   preparing for the previous meetings showed       15:57:24

                15   that if you pursued some version of Ares V       15:57:24

                16   you got Ares I very inexpensively, quote,        15:57:33

                17   unquote, the billion and a half or so.           15:57:33

                18           Does that still look like it's true,     15:57:33

                19   and is there any argument there?                 15:57:42

                20           DR. RIDE:  I think that this is          15:57:42

                21   partly where the fixed costs get you.            15:57:48

                22           Jeff, would that be your assessment?     15:57:48

                23   Yeah.                                            15:57:48

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  So once you get it,      15:57:48

                25   you've got to do something with it.              15:57:53





                                                               148



                 1           MR. GREASON:  Well, no, it's not         15:57:53

                 2   that.  If you have all of the money you could    15:57:53

                 3   wish for, then maybe it looks like a rounding    15:57:53

                 4   error to tack on the Ares I capability.          15:57:59

                 5           When you have to start thinking about    15:58:07

                 6   living within a budget, a vaguely realistic      15:58:07

                 7   budget, things start to stretch out, and when    15:58:07

                 8   they stretch out and your fixed costs are        15:58:14

                 9   high, they cost a lot more.  That's part of      15:58:14

                10   the problem.                                     15:58:25

                11           And the other part of the problem is:    15:58:25

                12   Even when you look at what we're calling the     15:58:25

                13   less constrained scenario, what's Ares I for?    15:58:25

                14   Well, it's ultimately for bringing Orion to      15:58:25

                15   the ISS.  But we actually haven't got a          15:58:25

                16   scenario in which you can get that capability    15:58:34

                17   before ISS is about ready to splash.             15:58:34

                18           If you retire ISS in 2015, you can       15:58:34

                19   get Ares/Orion I (sic) in around 2016.           15:58:41

                20   That's not so helpful.  But if we extend ISS     15:58:47

                21   to 2020, it tends to slip the availability of    15:58:47

                22   Ares I/Orion to 2020.  So it's questionable      15:58:55

                23   whether this is an element that makes sense      15:58:55

                24   to do.                                           15:58:55

                25           MR. AUGUSTINE:  But if there are no      15:58:55





                                                               149



                 1   human flights to LEO beyond 2020, the            15:59:08

                 2   benefits of human rating -- well, the            15:59:08

                 3   expendables are that you only get a couple of    15:59:08

                 4   years to the space station -- to ISS.            15:59:08

                 5           MR. GREASON:  Well, but we also --       15:59:19

                 6   there's an uncertain but potentially             15:59:19

                 7   significant cost associated with saying your     15:59:19

                 8   large heavy lifter also has to be human rated    15:59:25

                 9   and be a crew carrier.  So in a very large       15:59:29

                10   number of the scenarios that we're looking       15:59:32

                11   at, even after the ISS ceases to continue,       15:59:32

                12   commercial crew services are still used to       15:59:36

                13   ferry the astronauts up to your exploration      15:59:40

                14   system, whatever that may be.                    15:59:46

                15           MR. AUGUSTINE:  But you could also       15:59:46

                16   use the Ares I to do that too.                   15:59:46

                17           MR. GREASON:  You could.  But now        15:59:53

                18   you're back to the problem that what did you     15:59:53

                19   do with ISS while -- as long as you had it.      15:59:53

                20           DR. CRAWLEY:  It goes to also the        16:00:05

                21   cost of maintaining the operability of two       16:00:05

                22   federal systems, right.                          16:00:05

                23           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         16:00:05

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  I mean, there's an         16:00:16

                25   argument that the recurring cost of the          16:00:16





                                                               150



                 1   smaller vehicle is less, but there's also an     16:00:16

                 2   argument that you have two -- you basically      16:00:16

                 3   have two programs running, two launch            16:00:16

                 4   facilities running, two processing facilities    16:00:16

                 5   running and --                                   16:00:30

                 6           MR. AUGUSTINE:  But if you don't have    16:00:30

                 7   Ares I, you have to maintain one of the          16:00:30

                 8   expendables.                                     16:00:30

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  Not in all scenarios.      16:00:30

                10   In some of the scenarios the Ares V Lite is      16:00:30

                11   human rated.                                     16:00:30

                12           MR. AUGUSTINE:  That's right.            16:00:30

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  In every scenario          16:00:48

                14   either -- other than the program of record,      16:00:48

                15   either the Ares V Lite is human rated or         16:00:48

                16   we've provided for commercial taxi to LEO.       16:00:48

                17           DR. RIDE:  Right.  That's right.         16:00:48

                18           Okay.  You know, I think the points      16:00:48

                19   here are fairly obvious.                         16:00:48

                20           Exploration really doesn't look          16:01:07

                21   viable under the FY '10 budget guidance --       16:01:07

                22   the guidance and run-out that we've been         16:01:07

                23   given.  Even the Dash Out of LEO doesn't get     16:01:07

                24   you anywhere, and we're still looking for        16:01:07

                25   that existence proof.                            16:01:26





                                                               151



                 1           Some things are more expensive than      16:01:26

                 2   others.  We've seen that.  Deep Space appears    16:01:26

                 3   to be the most cost effective of the             16:01:26

                 4   exploration scenarios, and it has earlier        16:01:26

                 5   return also.  You know, so I'm sure we'll be     16:01:26

                 6   talking about these later on this afternoon.     16:01:26

                 7           And some heavy-lift options, other       16:01:48

                 8   than the program of record, appear more cost     16:01:48

                 9   effective, although less lift capability, and    16:01:48

                10   they have other issues with them that we've      16:01:48

                11   discussed.                                       16:01:48

                12           And with that, Mr. Chairman, I'm         16:01:48

                13   eager to get off of the stage.                   16:02:06

                14           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Very well done,          16:02:06

                15   Sally.  Thanks to you and your crew and all      16:02:06

                16   of the folks from NASA and Aerospace who sure    16:02:06

                17   put in a lot of hours on that, and we've         16:02:06

                18   still got some more to do.                       16:02:06

                19           Bo...                                    16:02:28

                20           MR. BEJMUK:  Sally, you had a, I         16:02:28

                21   thought, very useful comment before you          16:02:28

                22   actually got up to the podium, and that had      16:02:28

                23   to do with cost of operations and                16:02:28

                24   operability.                                     16:02:28

                25           And I've been trying to be on a          16:02:28





                                                               152



                 1   campaign since I -- ever since I retired         16:02:28

                 2   trying to suggest to NASA that it's              16:02:28

                 3   worthwhile to attempt to change its design       16:02:28

                 4   culture we design systems not for maximum        16:02:51

                 5   performance and minimum DDT&E cost but design    16:02:51

                 6   them a little more -- with a little more         16:02:51

                 7   eyesight toward the cost of operations, and I    16:02:51

                 8   don't know we -- you made the similar            16:02:51

                 9   comment.                                         16:02:51

                10           Could you just say a few more            16:02:51

                11   words -- how do you -- how could we, in our      16:02:51

                12   report, maybe with the help of our chairman,     16:02:51

                13   restate the recommendation to NASA that          16:03:09

                14   minimum DDT&E and maximum performance should     16:03:09

                15   perhaps not be the only criteria to avoid        16:03:09

                16   spending decades later of paying through your    16:03:21

                17   nose in terms of ops costs.                      16:03:21

                18           DR. RIDE:  I think these charts          16:03:21

                19   actually show that fairly well.                  16:03:21

                20           If you look even in the out-years at     16:03:29

                21   the exploration programs where we've -- in       16:03:29

                22   those cases where we've managed to achieve       16:03:29

                23   some capability and we're actually starting      16:03:40

                24   to explore the operations costs, the fixed       16:03:40

                25   costs associated with operating those systems    16:03:40





                                                               153



                 1   is very charge.  You know, the budget in the     16:03:52

                 2   out-years with only exploration around --        16:03:52

                 3   there's no shuttle, there's no station to        16:03:52

                 4   blame these costs on -- it's all                 16:03:52

                 5   exploration -- and they're quite large.          16:04:04

                 6           You know, and so looking at those and    16:04:04

                 7   seeing that those costs run out over long        16:04:04

                 8   periods of time, you know, the message is        16:04:04

                 9   really clear -- you should be working now to     16:04:04

                10   minimize those costs.  You should be working     16:04:19

                11   to minimize the operations costs to the          16:04:19

                12   maximum extent possible even if it costs you     16:04:19

                13   a little bit more in the development phase,      16:04:19

                14   even if it costs you a little bit of             16:04:34

                15   capability.                                      16:04:34

                16           You know, all engineers want as much     16:04:34

                17   capability as they can get, and that's a good    16:04:34

                18   thing.  All operations people want operations    16:04:34

                19   to be as simple as possible, and that's also     16:04:34

                20   a good thing.  And trying to find the right      16:04:34

                21   mix of those is a bit of an art, and it's an     16:04:53

                22   art that, I think, we lose track at our          16:04:53

                23   peril.                                           16:04:53

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think, Bo, you make    16:04:53

                25   a very good point.  But just to be the           16:04:53





                                                               154



                 1   devil's advocate, I suspect you can't -- if      16:04:53

                 2   you properly cost-account, namely, if you        16:04:53

                 3   discount future costs, you can't afford to       16:05:16

                 4   spend very much more in development to save      16:05:16

                 5   operations costs 20 years from now.  So I'm      16:05:16

                 6   just being difficult here but...                 16:05:16

                 7           MR. BEJMUK:  And that's what we          16:05:16

                 8   always do.  The only thing is that 20 years      16:05:16

                 9   will come, you know, and we keep paying and      16:05:16

                10   paying and paying and the time value of money    16:05:16

                11   seems to matter little to NASA, you know,        16:05:30

                12   like --                                          16:05:30

                13           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, the government     16:05:30

                14   doesn't even discount --                         16:05:30

                15           MR. BEJMUK:  Yeah.                       16:05:30

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- as far as I know.     16:05:30

                17   That reminds me -- on the same kind of thing,    16:05:30

                18   Sally, we used two -- or I think it was          16:05:30

                19   you -- yeah.  We used 2.4 percent for            16:05:30

                20   inflation.  That's double what the OMB is        16:05:48

                21   using.  I'd sure bet on us.  But the question    16:05:48

                22   is going to come up what makes you -- where      16:05:48

                23   did the 2.4 come from.  Was that -- do we        16:05:48

                24   have any authority for that?                     16:05:48

                25           DR. RIDE:  You're not going to take      16:05:48





                                                               155



                 1   the word of the physicist/astronaut on the       16:06:13

                 2   future rate of inflation?                        16:06:13

                 3           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, you said you       16:06:13

                 4   studied English too.                             16:06:13

                 5           DR. RIDE:  Actually one of the things    16:06:13

                 6   that was illuminating to us is the cost of       16:06:13

                 7   inflation that NASA uses to inflate its          16:06:13

                 8   future costs going out.  And I think that        16:06:13

                 9   number was 2.7 percent.  Is that right?          16:06:13

                10           Mike, do you know if that's right?       16:06:13

                11           It's -- 2.4 to 2.7 percent is the        16:06:43

                12   cost that NASA typically uses to take into       16:06:43

                13   account inflation in the out-years.              16:06:43

                14           MR. AUGUSTINE:  So then you have         16:06:43

                15   another built-in problem.  OMB funds you at      16:06:43

                16   1.2, if you're lucky, and NASA is putting        16:06:43

                17   2.7 in --                                        16:06:43

                18           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         16:06:43

                19           MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- and we all know it    16:06:43

                20   will be 3-1/2.                                   16:06:43

                21           DR. RIDE:  You know, that's right.       16:06:43

                22           MR. AUGUSTINE:  A fact of life.          16:06:43

                23           Sally, thank you.                        16:07:09

                24           DR. RIDE:  Thank you.                    16:07:09

                25           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Terrific job.            16:07:09





                                                               156



                 1           Okay.  Now we're going to -- we've       16:07:09

                 2   talked about the options.  We've talked about    16:07:09

                 3   the cost of the options.  And now we've been     16:07:09

                 4   working for most of the time since we've been    16:07:09

                 5   together on putting together the metrics by      16:07:09

                 6   which we want to evaluate these options or at    16:07:09

                 7   least assess the individual qualities of the     16:07:09

                 8   options, and Wanda has been leading that         16:07:34

                 9   effort along with a group of folks.              16:07:34

                10           And so, Wanda, it's your turn to         16:07:34

                11   report on that.                                  16:07:34

                12           DR. AUSTIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.    16:07:34

                13           I think it's fair to say that all of     16:07:34

                14   the committee members have invested some skin    16:07:34

                15   in the game on this issue.  So I'm pleased to    16:07:34

                16   report out what I believe is a set of            16:07:34

                17   criteria that reflect the interests and          16:08:02

                18   concerns of everyone on the committee.  Let's    16:08:02

                19   go to the first chart.                           16:08:02

                20           This is just a little bit of a           16:08:02

                21   revisit on the discussion that we had at KSC     16:08:02

                22   where we talked about the importance of          16:08:02

                23   defining the basis for evaluation.  As with      16:08:02

                24   any good systems engineering process, it's       16:08:02

                25   really important to nail down the                16:08:22





                                                               157



                 1   requirements, which was captured for us by       16:08:22

                 2   our charter and statement of task, and then      16:08:22

                 3   assessing how you are going to be able to        16:08:22

                 4   validate or verify that, in fact, what you've    16:08:22

                 5   done meets those requirements.  And so we        16:08:22

                 6   felt it was very important to start off by       16:08:22

                 7   a priori talking about what would be the         16:08:40

                 8   criteria or figures of merit that we would       16:08:40

                 9   want to assess.                                  16:08:40

                10           So in terms of defining what it was      16:08:40

                11   that we were asked to do, it was certainly to    16:08:40

                12   expedite a new U.S. capability to support        16:08:40

                13   utilization of the station, to support           16:08:56

                14   missions to the Moon and other destinations      16:08:56

                15   beyond low Earth orbit, to stimulate the         16:08:56

                16   commercial space flight capability and           16:08:56

                17   engagement and to fit within the current         16:08:56

                18   budget.  So those were clear guidance and        16:09:12

                19   boundaries that were set for us from the         16:09:12

                20   outset.                                          16:09:12

                21           We also looked at some other metrics     16:09:12

                22   that were determined by the panel members as     16:09:12

                23   being key to coming forward with options that    16:09:12

                24   we felt answered the charge.                     16:09:12

                25           And we also reviewed the metrics and     16:09:26





                                                               158



                 1   figures of merit that had been used in           16:09:26

                 2   previous studies.  And the interesting thing     16:09:26

                 3   there was that there was a lot of commonality    16:09:26

                 4   with what we laid out and what others have       16:09:26

                 5   done in the past about what is really            16:09:39

                 6   critical in talking about human space flight     16:09:39

                 7   for the future.                                  16:09:39

                 8           I think it's important to also           16:09:39

                 9   mention that not all of the criteria are         16:09:39

                10   equally weighted.  And by that, I mean that,     16:09:53

                11   as you look at different options, there are      16:09:53

                12   some criteria that may have more weight or       16:09:53

                13   have more of an import on the effectiveness      16:09:53

                14   of that option than others.  But I think it's    16:10:10

                15   also very important to say that this is not a    16:10:10

                16   quantitative, turn the crank, run the numbers    16:10:10

                17   and get an answer out of the bottom, that        16:10:10

                18   clearly there's a lot of judgment and other      16:10:10

                19   factors that have to be weighed.                 16:10:10

                20           We will do that in our process as we     16:10:25

                21   go thorough our evaluation, and I believe        16:10:25

                22   that the other decision makers, when we          16:10:25

                23   deliver our options, will also have an           16:10:25

                24   opportunity to have a layer of assessing         16:10:25

                25   which criteria they weight and how they          16:10:40





                                                               159



                 1   weight them.                                     16:10:40

                 2           So that's the methodology that we've     16:10:40

                 3   undertaken.  Next chart.                         16:10:40

                 4           Also when we were at KSC, I shared at    16:10:40

                 5   the public meeting a little bit of the           16:10:40

                 6   motivation of how we're thinking about this.     16:10:52

                 7   And this is a 3D representation or three         16:10:52

                 8   dimensional, if you will.  But clearly in one    16:10:52

                 9   dimension you have the benefits to               16:10:52

                10   stakeholders, which you want to try to           16:10:52

                11   optimize, and you also have the reality of       16:11:03

                12   cost profiles that are laid out year by year     16:11:03

                13   in the President's budget that you have to       16:11:03

                14   try to meet.                                     16:11:03

                15           And our experience has been that when    16:11:03

                16   you constrain a problem fairly significantly     16:11:03

                17   then the one dimension in which you have some    16:11:15

                18   option for movement, it is in the dimension      16:11:15

                19   of risk.  So as you over-constrain the           16:11:15

                20   problem in the other directions, what you        16:11:25

                21   then do is increase the risk to the program      16:11:25

                22   and the ability to execute that program.         16:11:25

                23           So I think we all recognize that.        16:11:25

                24   Next chart.                                      16:11:40

                25           And for any option that you might        16:11:40





                                                               160



                 1   choose, what you would find is that as you       16:11:40

                 2   look at all of the criteria in this              16:11:40

                 3   three-dimensional volume you'll see that         16:11:40

                 4   these items move relative to each other.  So     16:11:40

                 5   they're not really independent.                  16:11:51

                 6           The size of the circles are just         16:11:51

                 7   simply to indicate that, in fact, there's a      16:11:51

                 8   level of uncertainty about them, that it's       16:11:51

                 9   not a point solution and that you've got to      16:11:51

                10   recognize, as we have with the options that      16:12:05

                11   we've tried to come up with, that different      16:12:05

                12   combinations may put you in a different          16:12:05

                13   position in that space.  So, here again, the     16:12:05

                14   message is just one that it is not a black       16:12:05

                15   and white single point that we're trying to      16:12:24

                16   get to but try to identify options that are      16:12:24

                17   in a reasonable space.                           16:12:24

                18           The dimension that's not reflected       16:12:24

                19   here is that depending upon when you get a       16:12:24

                20   capability may that move capability in this      16:12:24

                21   space relative to the other options.  For        16:12:24

                22   example, if you don't get human lunar return     16:12:48

                23   until 2028 versus getting it in 2020, that       16:12:48

                24   you need to reflect that as well.  So the        16:12:48

                25   bottom line is we need to make sure that we      16:12:48





                                                               161



                 1   find options that are affordable, innovative,    16:12:48

                 2   safe and sustainable.                            16:12:48

                 3           So with that, may I have the next        16:12:48

                 4   chart.  And what I am going to do is walk        16:12:48

                 5   through the 12 criteria that we have settled     16:12:48

                 6   on -- we had 11 when we were at KSC, we've       16:13:15

                 7   added one -- to try to find a consistent way     16:13:15

                 8   to assess all of the options that are going      16:13:15

                 9   to be on our list of options to recommend or     16:13:15

                10   to evaluate.  The first one being Exploration    16:13:15

                11   Preparation.                                     16:13:15

                12           Now, let me just take a second to        16:13:15

                13   explain the format of the chart.  The top        16:13:15

                14   gray area of the box is just a short             16:13:43

                15   description of what we mean by that criteria,    16:13:43

                16   what's included in that area.                    16:13:43

                17           Down the left-hand side is a relative    16:13:43

                18   scoring.  So zero represents the baseline        16:13:43

                19   capability, a minus one says that you don't      16:13:43

                20   deliver as much value as the baseline, minus     16:13:43

                21   two says you deliver even less.  And             16:13:43

                22   similarly in the other direction, a one means    16:14:07

                23   that, in fact, delivers more capability or       16:14:07

                24   value than the baseline case, and a two says     16:14:07

                25   it's significantly better than the baseline      16:14:07





                                                               162



                 1   case.                                            16:14:07

                 2           So in the area of exploration            16:14:07

                 3   preparation, the baseline means that we have     16:14:07

                 4   limited beyond LEO exploration capability.       16:14:07

                 5   And in some terminology, that would be flags     16:14:07

                 6   and footprints but not really an exploration     16:14:21

                 7   program that meets the goals that have been      16:14:21

                 8   laid out.                                        16:14:21

                 9           Going to the top of the chart there,     16:14:21

                10   what you would expect to assess an option        16:14:29

                11   where exploration is limited to LEO and, in      16:14:29

                12   fact, you don't have much capability beyond      16:14:29

                13   station or the space shuttle program, that       16:14:37

                14   that would get a ranking of a minus two.         16:14:37

                15           And on the other extreme, a plus two     16:14:43

                16   would be something -- an option that provides    16:14:43

                17   operational robustness, it provides              16:14:43

                18   flexibility, it provides on-ramps for            16:14:48

                19   technology and it provides an opportunity to     16:14:48

                20   explore different destinations beyond LEO.       16:14:52

                21           Next is Science Knowledge, and the       16:14:56

                22   objective here is to address the critical        16:15:00

                23   research areas consistent with the priorities    16:15:03

                24   identified by the scientific community, and      16:15:08

                25   for reference we use the decadal surveys.  We    16:15:11





                                                               163



                 1   had briefings from representatives from that     16:15:15

                 2   community which were insightful in terms of      16:15:19

                 3   understanding what the opportunities might be    16:15:21

                 4   for scientific research.                         16:15:23

                 5           The baseline case here is limited        16:15:26

                 6   opportunity for research that is, in fact,       16:15:29

                 7   consistent with the priorities, but it lacks     16:15:32

                 8   actually an implementation plan or an            16:15:36

                 9   execution plan to fully leverage the             16:15:39

                10   opportunities that are presented.                16:15:42

                11           Going in the positive side, a plus       16:15:44

                12   one says that, in fact, you would address        16:15:48

                13   some of the priorities that the scientific       16:15:50

                14   community identified, and a plus two says        16:15:52

                15   that you significantly address those critical    16:15:56

                16   priorities with a plan and implement -- and      16:15:58

                17   dollars to support actually the research         16:16:00

                18   that's there.                                    16:16:02

                19           The minus two category says that         16:16:03

                20   really there is not a plan for science           16:16:06

                21   research.  It's not recognized as a priority     16:16:10

                22   for the program for that option.                 16:16:15

                23           The next chart is Technology             16:16:15

                24   Innovation.  The focus here is whether or not    16:16:18

                25   there's an opportunity to enable tech            16:16:21





                                                               164



                 1   maturity as well as new modes of exploration     16:16:24

                 2   as a result of technology insertion and to --    16:16:28

                 3   and, in fact, gain national leadership in        16:16:32

                 4   innovation through technology.  We feel that,    16:16:35

                 5   you know, the Human Space Flight program has     16:16:40

                 6   a potential to provide that capability or        16:16:41

                 7   that opportunity.                                16:16:43

                 8           The baseline case here says that         16:16:45

                 9   technology maturation is, in fact, required      16:16:47

                10   to support the exploration mission.              16:16:50

                11           Going in the positive direction, a       16:16:52

                12   plus two would provide significant enabling      16:16:55

                13   technology innovation that could be applied      16:17:00

                14   to the Human Space Flight program and beyond.    16:17:02

                15           And minus two says that we use very      16:17:05

                16   current or very near term technologies only.     16:17:07

                17   So, you know, we would assess that from an       16:17:10

                18   exploration program as probably not reaching     16:17:16

                19   far enough.                                      16:17:20

                 1   previous slide, Science Knowledge.  When we      16:17:24

                 2   say significantly addresses many critical        16:17:25

                 3   priorities of the scientific community, one      16:17:29

                 4   thing that became clear in the presentations     16:17:34

                 5   by members or chairs of the decadal surveys      16:17:34

                 6   in the four areas where there are decadal        16:17:37

                 7   underway, Earth science, physics and biology,    16:17:39

                 8   planetary science biology, one thing that        16:17:41

                 9   was -- I'm sorry -- and astrophysics, one        16:17:46

                10   thing that was clear is that many of their       16:17:49

                11   critical priorities -- and in some of those      16:17:51

                12   cases all of their critical priorities --        16:17:53

                13   they view as really not intersecting with        16:17:58

                14   human space flight at all.                       16:18:01

                15           So when we say significantly             16:17:25

                16   addresses many critical priorities, I think      16:17:29

                17   implicit in that has to be a sense of -- of      16:18:06

                18   those that human space flight can hope to        16:18:06

                19   address in a reasonable manner.  We're not       16:18:06

                20   certainly grading against the -- you know, in    16:18:12

                21   Earth science, they have 17 missions they        16:18:12

                22   want to fly, and none of those involve           16:18:12

                23   astronauts.  So we're not saying that somehow    16:18:22

                24   we have to take over those missions.             16:18:22

                25           DR. AUSTIN:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And     16:18:22





                                                               166



                 1   another clarification I should have mentioned    16:18:33

                 2   on that is that we're not using that category    16:18:33

                 3   to assess research on humans in space, long      16:18:33

                 4   duration exposure or any of those crew           16:18:33

                 5   effects factors.  That will be captured under    16:18:40

                 6   another category called Expanding Human          16:18:40

                 7   Civilization, which is the chart that we're      16:18:46

                 8   up to.                                           16:18:46

                 9           This category is really talking about    16:18:46

                10   our ability with these options to get to a       16:18:53

                11   presence off planet, and it would enable, in     16:18:53

                12   fact, a sustained human presence and/or          16:18:59

                13   bases.                                           16:18:59

                14           This baseline case here says that it     16:18:59

                15   would lead to a presence off planet and it       16:19:04

                16   would support search for crew effects, which     16:19:10

                17   would include radiation exposure, zero- or       16:19:10

                18   low-g or psychological issues that would need    16:19:10

                19   to be worked.                                    16:19:14

                20           In the plus direction, it addresses      16:19:14

                21   those crew oriented effects with an objective    16:19:17

                22   to enable sustained human presence, and a        16:19:19

                23   plus two says that we're moving toward           16:19:22

                24   enabling a sustaining human presence             16:19:27

                25   off planet utilizing in situ resources or        16:19:33





                                                               167



                 1   could also be used to enhance the protection     16:19:35

                 2   of the Earth.                                    16:19:40

                 3           In the minus direction, you have an      16:19:40

                 4   option that, in fact, does not enable human      16:19:50

                 5   presence, but a minus one would say that it      16:19:50

                 6   would enable a visit beyond LEO.  So there is    16:19:50

                 7   some credit assessment there for getting         16:19:56

                 8   beyond LEO but not getting as far on             16:19:56

                 9   generating that sustained human presence.        16:20:03

                10           DR. CHYBA:  Wanda, I'm sorry.            16:20:03

                11           DR. AUSTIN:  Sure.                       16:20:03

                12           DR. CHYBA:  One more comment on this     16:20:08

                13   chart.  I would add -- perhaps it's implicit     16:20:08

                14   here.  There's one other consideration with      16:20:10

                15   respect to the human civilization category, I    16:20:13

                16   think, which is -- well, to put it in terms      16:20:13

                17   that we would rank numerically, I would argue    16:20:18

                18   that missions that go to near Earth objects      16:20:18

                19   should be weighted more heavily -- or            16:20:26

                20   weighted in a separate category but factor in    16:20:29

                21   from missions that help us develop sustained     16:20:32

                22   human presence, because missions to NEOs will    16:20:34

                23   help us understand how to mitigate the impact    16:20:38

                24   hazard and that's important for sustaining       16:20:40

                25   human civilization on this planet in the long    16:20:42

                 1   run.                                             16:20:46

                 2           DR. AUSTIN:  Agreed.  And it is          16:20:46

                 3   implicit here that you can define the            16:20:48

                 4   destination that, in fact, is on the path        16:20:50

                 5   that gets you to sustained human presence or     16:20:50

                 6   exploration to Mars.                             16:20:53

                 7           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Chris, would you make    16:20:59

                 8   that a whole new category or part of this?       16:20:59

                 9           DR. CHYBA:  You know, it's folded in     16:21:11

                10   in the plus two category here.  I would just     16:21:11

                11   suggest that it sort of needs to factor in,      16:21:11

                12   you know, in the plus one category as well at    16:21:11

                13   least.                                           16:21:11

                14           DR. AUSTIN:  Okay.                       16:21:11

                15           MR. GREASON:  In my own head when I      16:21:11

                16   was doing this, my thought was having that       16:21:22

                17   feature kind of bumps you up one in the          16:21:22

                18   category chart, you know, whatever it is.        16:21:22

                19           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, another way to     16:21:22

                20   do it is to make it part of the title            16:21:22

                21   including...                                     16:21:34

                22           DR. AUSTIN:  Including NEO.              16:21:34

                23           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  So the whole      16:21:34

                24   chart --                                         16:21:34

                 1   human civilization, something like that.         16:21:34

                 2           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.                    16:21:34

                 3           DR. AUSTIN:  Yeah.                       16:21:34

                 4           DR. CHYBA:  We'll have to be careful     16:21:34

                 5   because we don't want to -- this is not meant    16:21:40

                 6   to capture, you know, global warming             16:21:40

                 7   observations or something --                     16:21:40

                 8           MR. AUGUSTINE:  No.                      16:21:40

                 9           DR. CHYBA:  -- so we need to be          16:21:40

                10   careful.                                         16:21:40

                11           MR. AUGUSTINE:  But maybe you could      16:21:40

                12   do some wording that --                          16:21:48

                13           DR. CHYBA:  Yeah.  I'm sure that --      16:21:48

                14           MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- that way there's a    16:21:48

                15   title that you could rate each of the systems    16:21:48

                16   across the board against that.                   16:21:48

                17           DR. AUSTIN:  Yeah.  I think it's good    16:21:48

                18   to include it explicitly so that we recognize    16:21:48

                19   that --                                          16:21:54

                20           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Right.                   16:21:54

                21           DR. AUSTIN:  -- that is a value          16:21:54

                22   characteristic of a particular option.           16:21:54

                 1   will have on the industrial base.  The vision    16:22:12

                 2   would certainly be to have a growing,            16:22:12

                 3   profitable industrial base, that you would       16:22:12

                 4   look to see commercial engagement and            16:22:19

                 5   potentially an increase in U.S. development      16:22:19

                 6   and production capabilities in key areas.        16:22:19

                 7           The baseline here says that we would     16:22:28

                 8   sustain the current U.S. industrial base with    16:22:28

                 9   some new opportunities for engagement.           16:22:28

                10           In the minus two capability, what you    16:22:36

                11   would see is a diminish in technical             16:22:36

                12   capability.  So this is not just in business     16:22:36

                13   base.  This is not in dollars.  It's about       16:22:44

                14   our technical ability.  But no opportunity       16:22:44

                15   for commercial participation would get minus     16:22:44

                16   two.                                             16:22:53

                17           On the plus two side, what you'd see     16:22:53

                18   is commercial systems being an integral part     16:22:53

                19   or another way to think about it might be on     16:22:53

                20   the critical path of the architecture where      16:23:02

                21   it's not just, you know, if they get there,      16:23:02

                22   fine, but, in fact, we are relying on the        16:23:02

                23   commercial engagement in order to be             16:23:08

                24   successful to the exploration program as a       16:23:08

                 1           The next chart is Global Partnership,    16:23:13

                 2   and this, again, is addressing one of the        16:23:15

                 3   critical objectives given to us in the -- in     16:23:18

                 4   our charter.  But what we want to assess the     16:23:21

                 5   options here is whether or not they leverage     16:23:25

                 6   and expand our international partnerships.       16:23:29

                 7   We had a lot of input during our public          16:23:32

                 8   meetings from our international partners, and    16:23:37

                 9   we need to identify, I think, in the options     16:23:40

                10   where they, in fact, support and really          16:23:45

                11   leverage those partnerships going forward.       16:23:48

                12           So the baseline case here says simply    16:23:51

                13   sustaining existing partnership.                 16:23:54

                14           The plus two says we not only expand     16:23:56

                15   the relationship with existing partners but      16:23:59

                16   consider adding new partners.                    16:24:02

                17           And in the minus two says that the       16:24:04

                18   option really discourages further                16:24:06

                19   participation (sic) involvement.                 16:24:12

                20           The next chart is Public Engagement,     16:24:13

                21   and this is one where --                         16:24:16

                22           MR. BEJMUK:  Wanda, may I ask you a      16:24:16

                23   question?                                        16:24:20

                24           DR. AUSTIN:  Of course.                  16:24:20

                25           MR. BEJMUK:  On this global              16:24:21





                                                               172



                 1   partnership or international partnership, are    16:24:22

                 2   you thinking more in terms of political or       16:24:24

                 3   world peacemaking implications, or are you       16:24:28

                 4   thinking in terms of if you bring                16:24:32

                 5   international partners and they bring value      16:24:35

                 6   or money to this joint project our costs will    16:24:37

                 7   go down or both?                                 16:24:41

                 8           DR. AUSTIN:  I think the real answer     16:24:43

                 9   is yes and yes, that we think that there's an    16:24:46

                10   opportunity for both.                            16:24:49

                11           We also would say that you would have    16:24:49

                12   to look at the opportunity as, quote,            16:24:53

                13   unquote, money saver very carefully.  Because    16:24:55

                14   our experience has shown that, you know, you     16:24:58

                15   may have a hard time taking that to the bank     16:25:00

                16   to get a real visible cost savings.              16:25:04

                17           But clearly, I think, when Sally was     16:25:07

                18   going through the options, we did not presume    16:25:08

                19   that an international partnership involvement    16:25:11

                20   in those options would save money and,           16:25:16

                21   therefore, take credit for it.  But I think      16:25:18

                22   that there's certainly that opportunity, and     16:25:21

                23   the partners expressed a desire to increase      16:25:22

                24   their roles in this direction.                   16:25:26

                25           I would say, on the other hand, you      16:25:28





                                                               173



                 1   know, space is multinational and that there      16:25:30

                 2   are things that we can benefit from in terms     16:25:34

                 3   of collaboration in building relationships       16:25:35

                 4   and established communications, and we've        16:25:38

                 5   learned a lot and gained a lot from station      16:25:42

                 6   from that perspective.                           16:25:45

                 7           And so I think that the sense is that    16:25:48

                 8   would be a good thing to assess the options      16:25:48

                 9   in terms of the opportunity for increased        16:25:52

                10   partnership.                                     16:25:58

                11           MR. BEJMUK:  Thank you.                  16:25:58

                12           DR. AUSTIN:  Sure.                       16:25:58

                13           Public Engagement is next.  The focus    16:25:58

                14   here is motivate and inspire -- it might also    16:26:03

                15   include educate -- current and future            16:26:03

                16   generations and also to provide societal         16:26:06

                17   benefits where the general public would see      16:26:10

                18   the benefit to society of this human space       16:26:12

                19   flight capabilities.                             16:26:16

                20           The baseline case here, it says that,    16:26:16

                21   you know, we gain public interest and focuses    16:26:19

                22   on beyond LEO exploration.                       16:26:23

                23           The plus two category says you           16:26:28

                24   actually galvanize a broad public interest       16:26:28

                25   and engage the public in exploration, and        16:26:32





                                                               174



                 1   there's a number ways in which you can have      16:26:39

                 2   that.  I think certainly the Teacher in Space    16:26:39

                 3   program was one of the ways that we have         16:26:39

                 4   attempted to do that in the past.                16:26:47

                 5           The minus two category here says that    16:26:47

                 6   we fail to capture or stimulate public           16:26:47

                 7   interest at all where the public, you know,      16:26:56

                 8   either fails to see the value or it fails to     16:26:56

                 9   see that it's a good investment for us to be     16:26:56

                10   in human space flight for a particular           16:26:56

                11   option.                                          16:27:03

                12           Next is Safety and Mission Success.      16:27:03

                13   This is, you know, one of our key areas that     16:27:03

                14   we want to assess.  It may be that, you know,    16:27:14

                15   in particular, when we talk about, you know,     16:27:14

                16   your PowerPoint charts versus my rocket that     16:27:27

                17   we don't have sufficient insight into some of    16:27:27

                18   the options at this point, but I think it is     16:27:27

                19   important to understand where we'd like to       16:27:27

                20   see the options -- you know, what we would       16:27:34

                21   assess to be a good option relative to crew      16:27:34

                22   safety and mission success.  This also should    16:27:42

                23   be thought of as not just ascent safety but      16:27:42

                24   end-to-end mission safety so that you think      16:27:48

                25   about, you know, the end game and what the       16:27:48





                                                               175



                 1   issues are there.                                16:27:55

                 2           So the baseline here, again, tied to     16:27:55

                 3   the program of record is a crew safety risk      16:27:55

                 4   comparable to that which we have                 16:27:55

                 5   statistically had on shuttle.                    16:28:03

                 6           In the plus two category, you really     16:28:03

                 7   want to move the bar forward for crew safety     16:28:03

                 8   maybe as much as an order of magnitude.  In      16:28:09

                 9   the minus two category, what you're looking      16:28:09

                10   at is significant increased risk of loss of      16:28:17

                11   crew or loss of mission throughout the           16:28:17

                12   flight.                                          16:28:17

                13           The next chart is the Life Cycle         16:28:25

                14   Costs or affordability.  This is really          16:28:25

                15   looked at through 2020 consistent with the       16:28:25

                16   program record, but it also reflects the fact    16:28:32

                17   that we need to look at the Human Space          16:28:32

                18   Flight program in concert with other national    16:28:40

                19   needs, that clearly that there's not an          16:28:40

                20   unlimited budget here.  And so I think the       16:28:40

                21   less constrained budget that Sally talked        16:28:50

                22   about takes that into consideration as to say    16:28:50

                23   that there are some limits.                      16:28:50

                24           The baseline here is very simple.  It    16:28:50

                25   meets the President's budget.                    16:29:00





                                                               176



                 1           The minus one category, I think, is      16:29:00

                 2   consistent with the less constrained options     16:29:00

                 3   that we've been looking at.                      16:29:00

                 4           And the minus two is probably more       16:29:00

                 5   like the unconstrained or greatly exceeds the    16:29:00

                 6   President's budget.                              16:29:09

                 7           I didn't see any options that were       16:29:09

                 8   under the President's budget.  So I don't        16:29:09

                 9   think we'll be getting any scores in that        16:29:17

                10   category.                                        16:29:17

                11           The next chart is Schedule and           16:29:24

                12   Programmatic Risk.  And programmatic risk is     16:29:24

                13   really one of those areas in which a lot of      16:29:24

                14   factors can be included, but it's really         16:29:34

                15   about delivering a robust exploration            16:29:34

                16   capability on schedule.  And there are a lot     16:29:34

                17   of ways in which you can do that.                16:29:34

                18           One is you can take content out.  One    16:29:34

                19   is that you can make sure that your              16:29:34

                20   technology is sufficiently mature that you       16:29:46

                21   have very little technical risk.  But there's    16:29:46

                22   also the physical risk associated with that      16:29:46

                23   as well.                                         16:29:46

                24           In terms of evaluating it, we focused    16:29:46

                25   on the schedule because we think that's a        16:29:55





                                                               177



                 1   good indicator of the overall programmatic       16:29:55

                 2   risk.  And the baseline here is tied to the      16:29:55

                 3   program of record, which is human lunar          16:30:02

                 4   return in 2020.  And so the other scores are     16:30:02

                 5   relative to that target.                         16:30:07

                 6           What we're seeing is that, you know,     16:30:07

                 7   you may have options that provide no             16:30:07

                 8   exploration before the 2030 time frame where     16:30:14

                 9   we would give a minus one to something that      16:30:14

                10   provided exploration in the 2020 time frame.     16:30:14

                11           Programmatic Sustainability, the         16:30:21

                12   issue that we're trying to assess here is the    16:30:26

                13   likelihood of keeping the program sold, our      16:30:26

                14   ability to meet near term and continuing         16:30:31

                15   visible milestones, to not only continue to      16:30:35

                16   get support from the public but also from        16:30:39

                17   Congress and external agencies as well.          16:30:42

                18           But one of the things that has a         16:30:46

                19   potential of having value is if we had an        16:30:49

                20   option that really engaged industry and          16:30:52

                21   external agencies, for example, DOD.  If you     16:30:54

                22   could have an option where there's an opportunity16:30:56

                23   for synergy there, we would look at that as      16:30:57

                24   being an option that had a benefit.              16:31:01

                25           If, in addition to that, you also had    16:31:04





                                                               178



                 1   broad additional support from the                16:31:09

                 2   international partners as seeing value, we       16:31:09

                 3   thought that that would be something that        16:31:13

                 4   we'd want to assess.                             16:31:15

                 5           The next chart is actually two charts    16:31:15

                 6   that we're going to talk about on critical       16:31:19

                 7   skills and the impact on the workforce.          16:31:22

                 8           The first one is really talking about    16:31:22

                 9   the technical capability and the impact on       16:31:26

                10   the nation's critical skills, our ability to     16:31:32

                11   be -- to identify our core competencies and      16:31:32

                12   make sure that we maintain those competencies    16:31:39

                13   and our ability to develop new capabilities      16:31:39

                14   and new competencies.                            16:31:39

                15           So the baseline here says that we        16:31:46

                16   maintain selected critical skills and            16:31:46

                17   expertise, meaning we identify those which we    16:31:46

                18   think need to be continued for the               16:31:52

                19   foreseeable future.                              16:31:52

                20           In the minus direction, what you have    16:31:58

                21   is a significant loss of critical skills and     16:31:58

                22   expertise in areas that we still think are       16:31:58

                23   essential to being able to execute a             16:32:07

                24   successful exploration program.                  16:32:07

                25           And in the plus direction is an          16:32:07





                                                               179



                 1   option which allowed you to really               16:32:15

                 2   strategically realign the workforce to ensure    16:32:15

                 3   the availability or development of critical      16:32:15

                 4   skills that are needed going forward.            16:32:15

                 5           And, Bo, you know, you might make the    16:32:24

                 6   point here that if you're developing skills      16:32:24

                 7   in an area where you don't have experience       16:32:24

                 8   that that might be viewed as more of a risk,     16:32:31

                 9   but I think that for a particular option         16:32:31

                10   we'll need to factor that in.                    16:32:31

                11           The next chart is, again, about          16:32:38

                12   workforce, but it's really from the side of      16:32:38

                13   looking at the numbers of people in the space    16:32:44

                14   business.  And for the most part, that's         16:32:44

                15   driven by the overall total budget.              16:32:51

                16           So, again, the baseline case here is     16:32:51

                17   maintaining the workforce.                       16:32:51

                18           And in the minus direction, if you       16:32:51

                19   had a greater than 10 percent decrease in the    16:32:56

                20   total workforce -- that's industry and           16:32:59

                21   NASA -- because of a particular option, you      16:32:59

                22   would rate it that way.                          16:33:02

                23           And a plus two would be if you had a     16:33:04

                24   greater than 10 percent increase in the total    16:33:08

                25   workforce in human space flight.                 16:33:11

                 1           You know, we've had the comment          16:33:11

                 2   earlier today that clearly we have been          16:33:14

                 3   through that with different industries in        16:33:16

                 4   different times, but we think that it was        16:33:18

                 5   important to just lay that on the table as an    16:33:21

                 6   assessment that could be factored in.            16:33:25

                 7           MR. GREASON:  Wanda?                     16:33:27

                 8           DR. AUSTIN:  Yeah.                       16:33:27

                 9           MR. GREASON:  A question.                16:33:29

                10           DR. AUSTIN:  Sure.                       16:33:29

                11           MR. GREASON:  Because this is            16:33:29

                12   something we've gone around on and I'm not       16:33:32

                13   actually sure where we ended up.                 16:33:29

                14           DR. AUSTIN:  Okay.                       16:33:29

                15           MR. GREASON:  If a job moves from a      16:33:38

                16   NASA badge to a company badge or from a guy      16:33:38

                17   wearing a company badge to a guy wearing a       16:33:38

                18   NASA badge, is that neutral on this              16:33:38

                19   chart?                                           16:33:45

                20           DR. AUSTIN:  In this chart it's          16:33:45

                21   neutral, because we're looking at total          16:33:45

                22   workforce.                                       16:33:50

                23           MR. GREASON:  Thank you.                 16:33:50

                24           DR. AUSTIN:  Yeah.  Total U.S.           16:33:50

                25   capability.                                      16:33:50

                 1           Okay.  The next chart just in summary    16:33:50

                 2   with the --                                      16:33:58

                 3           MR. BEJMUK:  May I?                      16:33:58

                 4           DR. AUSTIN:  Sure.                       16:33:58

                 5           MR. BEJMUK:  You know, could you go      16:33:58

                 6   back to this previous chart.                     16:33:58

                 7           It seems to me that the best scenario    16:33:58

                 8   is where you maintain critical skills and you    16:34:07

                 9   change over between the old program and new      16:34:07

                10   program without either increasing or             16:34:11

                11   decreasing.                                      16:34:14

                12           Wouldn't that be like plus two?  You     16:34:14

                13   know, you've been saying that, you know, if      16:34:18

                14   you have an increase by more than 10 percent     16:34:19

                15   in a NASA workforce, it's a plus two; if it's    16:34:23

                16   decreased by more than 10 percent, it's minus    16:34:29

                17   two.  So I would think that would be -- the      16:34:33

                18   optimum scenario would be you've got these       16:34:36

                19   critical skills, you recycle them onto the       16:34:37

                20   new program, and I would have thought that       16:34:40

                21   they would be plus two.                          16:34:42

                22           Am I off the base?                       16:34:44

                23           DR. AUSTIN:  I think there's a couple    16:34:46

                24   of ways of looking at that.                      16:34:48

                25           One, Bo, might be efficiency -- you      16:34:50

                 1   know, are you doing things smarter, are you      16:34:52

                 2   working smarter.  You might still actually       16:34:54

                 3   get a decrease in total numbers, which you       16:34:57

                 4   actually may get a better product, or you get    16:35:00

                 5   to modernize the way in which you approach       16:35:04

                 6   something.                                       16:35:07

                 7           So I think that, you know, this          16:35:08

                 8   evaluation is really just trying to account      16:35:10

                 9   for the change in numbers.  It's not trying      16:35:12

                10   to pass judgment on whether it is good or not    16:35:14

                11   good but just to simply make sure that we        16:35:17

                12   recognize that a particular option may be        16:35:22

                13   having an impact.                                16:35:25

                14           MR. BEJMUK:  But you give -- this        16:35:27

                15   rating would give a program that increases       16:35:29

                16   NASA workforce positive credit.  Is that         16:35:32

                17   right?                                           16:35:32

                18           DR. AUSTIN:  In terms of increasing      16:35:32

                19   the workforce --                                 16:35:32

                20           MR. BEJMUK:  Is that how you             16:35:37

                21   basically view this?                             16:35:39

                22           MR. GREASON:  This is NASA.  I asked     16:35:39

                23   that earlier, Bo, because this is --             16:35:40

                24           DR. AUSTIN:  It is NASA and industry.    16:35:40

                25           MR. GREASON:  -- this is the national    16:35:41





                                                               183



                 1   workforce.                                       16:35:43

                 2           DR. AUSTIN:  Yeah.                       16:35:43

                 3           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  You know I --     16:35:43

                 4   well, we've got two charts that I'm having --    16:35:47

                 5   could we look at the other chart for just one    16:35:50

                 6   second.                                          16:35:53

                 7           Actually I think I got the titles --     16:35:59

                 8   this one should be -- the National Critical      16:36:00

                 9   Skills Impact would be a better title for it.    16:36:05

                10           DR. AUSTIN:  It says impact on           16:36:07

                11   nation's critical skills.                        16:36:09

                12           MR. AUGUSTINE:  It means the same        16:36:10

                13   thing, but it's the whole nation -- it is        16:36:12

                14   critical skills in every one.                    16:36:12

                15           DR. AUSTIN:  Right.                      16:36:12

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think it's the         16:36:13

                17   title that's the problem.  National Critical     16:36:13

                18   Skills Impact, and the next one would be the     16:36:20

                19   NASA Workforce Impact.                           16:36:22

                20           DR. AUSTIN:  Right.                      16:36:22

                21           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Or the total national    16:36:22

                22   workforce impact -- national workforce impact    16:36:27

                23   or just workforce impact would be better yet.    16:36:29

                24           DR. AUSTIN:  Yeah.  We can certainly     16:36:35

                25   change the previous chart to be National         16:36:37





                                                               184



                 1   Critical Skills.                                 16:36:39

                 2           MR. AUGUSTINE:  We can change the        16:36:39

                 3   title.  It doesn't change the rating any         16:36:45

                 4   because that's --                                16:36:47

                 5           DR. AUSTIN:  Yeah.                       16:36:47

                 6           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.                    16:36:47

                 7           DR. AUSTIN:  Okay.  Go ahead, Joe.       16:36:47

                 8   Next chart.                                      16:36:47

                 9           These two are just summaries to          16:36:48

                10   remind you of the general measure and to give    16:36:50

                11   a quick reminder of the criteria involved.       16:36:54

                12   Next chart.                                      16:36:57

                13           We want to look at the options           16:37:03

                14   against each of these measures.  And the last    16:37:06

                15   chart.                                           16:37:09

                16           This is where I pass it over to Ed       16:37:09

                17   and say, you know, all you've got to do, Ed,     16:37:09

                18   is fill in the answers and...                    16:37:13

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  The Professor brought      16:37:13

                20   the back of the book.                            16:37:13

                21           DR. AUSTIN:  There we go.  Super.        16:37:13

                22           Yeah, Bo.                                16:37:18

                23           MR. BEJMUK:  One last question from      16:37:19

                24   me.  Have we captured promoting education or     16:37:21

                25   promoting learning at all levels, I mean,        16:37:25





                                                               185



                 1   from my daughter's fourth grade to               16:37:29

                 2   Dr. Crawley's graduate students, because I       16:37:33

                 3   don't think we captured that, you know, the      16:37:36

                 4   effect of the program to promote learning or     16:37:37

                 5   promote education?                               16:37:41

                 6           DR. AUSTIN:  We did in the -- we         16:37:42

                 7   tried to reflect that in the public              16:37:45

                 8   engagement where --                              16:37:48

                 9           MR. BEJMUK:  Well, I looked at that.     16:37:50

                10           DR. AUSTIN:  And it may be that you      16:37:54

                11   want to be more specific, but, you know, the     16:37:55

                12   item 1 there is really about motivating STEM,    16:37:57

                13   it's aimed at being current and future           16:38:03

                14   generations.  So the intent was that that        16:38:06

                15   would be where you would look at an option to    16:38:09

                16   see its ability to, you know, have an impact     16:38:11

                17   with the public in that respect.                 16:38:17

                18           If you have a suggestion for a way to    16:38:21

                19   present that more directly, you know, we         16:38:24

                20   can --                                           16:38:29

                21           MR. BEJMUK:  Sally, you have an          16:38:29

                22   impact on education, I believe, you know.        16:38:32

                23   Seriously, do you think we ought to have         16:38:34

                24   something that gets a program created that       16:38:37

                25   inspires kids as well as his graduate            16:38:37





                                                               186



                 1   students, you know?                              16:38:41

                 2           DR. RIDE:  Of course, that's a --        16:38:43

                 3   that's important and it's critical and I         16:38:47

                 4   think that it's one of the things that a         16:38:51

                 5   well-designed space program does naturally       16:38:54

                 6   and can significantly contribute to.  I think    16:38:55

                 7   that it's captured appropriately here.           16:38:59

                 8           MR. BEJMUK:  You think -- okay.          16:39:03

                 9           DR. RIDE:  I do.  I do.                  16:39:03

                10           MR. BEJMUK:  Okay.  Thank you.           16:39:10

                11           DR. AUSTIN:  Thank you.                  16:39:14

                12           Mr. Chairman, if there are no other      16:39:14

                13   questions, I'll yield the podium to              16:39:17

                14   Professor Crawley.                               16:39:17

                15           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, I think you've     16:39:20

                16   done very well, but the Professor will fill      16:39:27

                17   out the chart here with what we're doing.        16:39:27

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, the Professor        16:39:27

                19   just realized that they only call me that        16:39:27

                20   when I'm in trouble, by the way.                 16:39:27

                21           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Oh, do they?             16:39:38

                22           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  You know, it's      16:39:38

                23   like when your mother calls you by your full     16:39:38

                24   name, you know.                                  16:39:38

                25           MR. AUGUSTINE:  That's not good,         16:39:38





                                                               187



                 1   right?                                           16:39:38

                 2           DR. AUSTIN:  Absolutely.                 16:39:38

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  That's not good.           16:39:46

                 4           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  The next thing    16:39:46

                 5   we want to do is to fill out the tables.  And    16:39:46

                 6   we've asked Ed to take a crack at it just to     16:39:46

                 7   give us a starting point in preparation, and     16:39:53

                 8   the group here, as a whole, will weigh in on     16:39:53

                 9   it, I'm sure.                                    16:39:59

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  And I'm just        16:40:03

                11   dealing with a logistical issue, Norm, which     16:40:03

                12   is we got it printed for the committee to be     16:40:03

                13   able to look at but we didn't get it into a      16:40:05

                14   chart so that we can project it.  So I'm         16:40:09

                15   just --                                          16:40:12

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Oh, I see.  So you're    16:40:12

                17   doing graphics.                                  16:40:18

                18           MR. McALISTER:  I'm just going to        16:40:18

                19   transfer it over to the driver.  There we go.    16:40:18

                20           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well done.               16:40:18

                21           MR. McALISTER:  We should announce       16:40:24

                22   that we have smelling sauce in the back for      16:40:25

                23   anybody that needs them after Sally's            16:40:30

                24   presentation.                                    16:40:30

                25           And also I thought it was kind of        16:40:31





                                                               188



                 1   amusing that Jeff thought that that one          16:40:32

                 2   commercial booster slide was the only            16:40:35

                 3   controversial slide in Sally's chart.  I         16:40:38

                 4   thought that was kind of cute.                   16:40:43

                 5           DR. RIDE:  That's because Jeff was       16:40:43

                 6   part of the process, so he was well worn         16:40:46

                 7   down.                                            16:40:51

                 8           MR. GREASON:  That one has drawn more    16:40:51

                 9   than its fair share of revisits in the --        16:40:54

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  True enough.               16:40:54

                11           MR. GREASON:  -- in the discussion.      16:40:55

                12           MR. McALISTER:  Well deserved.           16:40:55

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  Mr. Chairman,       16:40:58

                14   thank you for this opportunity to discuss        16:41:00

                15   this easy topic at the end of the day.           16:41:02

                16           So the process that we have engaged      16:41:05

                17   in outside of the FACA meeting is -- well,       16:41:08

                18   actually at the last meeting we presented the    16:41:11

                19   evaluation system -- actually in                 16:41:16

                20   Cocoa Beach -- right, Wanda -- we presented      16:41:18

                21   the evaluation system and recommended for its    16:41:22

                22   approval to the group, which was agreed, and     16:41:24

                23   then today we further defined the criteria       16:41:26

                24   that went with it.                               16:41:31

                25           And these, by the way, are linked        16:41:34





                                                               189



                 1   back through backup documents to the             16:41:37

                 2   evaluation criteria that are contained in the    16:41:41

                 3   OSTP, a statement of task, which I'll make       16:41:44

                 4   reference to occasionally in this discussion,    16:41:48

                 5   as well as one I mentioned earlier today, to     16:41:51

                 6   other historic and important policy              16:41:53

                 7   documents, the Space Act, the vision for         16:41:58

                 8   space exploration and so forth.                  16:42:00

                 9           So there are actually, in many of        16:42:01

                10   these cases, more words that are in the          16:42:03

                11   backup documents than have been presented in     16:42:06

                12   the public meeting, but they were agreed for     16:42:12

                13   inclusion by the committee.  Oh, there it is.    16:42:14

                14   Okay.                                            16:42:14

                15           So this -- what can only be              16:42:20

                16   considered an eye chart and probably not even    16:42:20

                17   visible to the people in the front row --        16:42:24

                18           MR. McALISTER:  So everybody move up     16:42:30

                19   to the front row.                                16:42:32

                20           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.                      16:42:32

                21           MR. McALISTER:  We can maybe get some    16:42:32

                22   printouts.                                       16:42:34

                23           DR. CRAWLEY:  Usually people drift to    16:42:34

                24   the back of the room in my classes anyway.       16:42:36

                25   So I'm used to it back there.                    16:42:39





                                                               190



                 1           So what we've done is we've taken        16:42:42

                 2   about dozen options which basically were left    16:42:46

                 3   on the table, Norm, after Sally's -- after       16:42:53

                 4   the analysis which Sally briefed.                16:42:58

                 5           And in some cases this has expanded      16:43:00

                 6   since the list we showed last week.  So, for     16:43:04

                 7   example, there's a Shuttle-Derived Deep Space    16:43:09

                 8   one in the list now.                             16:43:12

                 9           And in some cases it's contracted        16:43:12

                10   based on sort of the relatively obvious          16:43:17

                11   things that were falling on the floor.           16:43:17

                12           For example, the Dash Out of LEO, as     16:43:22

                13   Sally proposed, just didn't come anywhere        16:43:25

                14   close to its intent, which was to try and        16:43:28

                15   find a way to get out of LEO as fast as          16:43:32

                16   possible and, in fact, didn't produce a step     16:43:37

                17   out of LEO until the end of the budget window    16:43:37

                18   in the constrained situation.                    16:43:37

                19           So with the permission of the group,     16:43:40

                20   what we've done is we have added a few here      16:43:43

                21   and there and we've subtracted a few here and    16:43:46

                22   there to produce this set for the final          16:43:51

                23   discussion.                                      16:43:54

                24           So what I'll do is I'll just read        16:43:54

                25   down it for those of you who can't read it.      16:43:57





                                                               191



                 1   And if we had two projectors, at this point      16:44:04

                 2   we would project the last chart of the           16:44:08

                 3   morning, but, of course, we don't have two       16:44:08

                 4   projectors, so I'll try and make the             16:44:11

                 5   connections.                                     16:44:14

                 6           The first one is the program of          16:44:14

                 7   record adjusted for risk, as are all of the      16:44:18

                 8   ones, all of the analyses were done by Aerospace 16:44:25

                 9   unconstrained by the budget.  That's what we     16:44:25

                10   call -- that's our best estimate of what the     16:44:25

                11   program would have executed had they been        16:44:31

                12   given the budget.                                16:44:31

                13           The second one is the program of         16:44:31

                14   record adjusted to risk constrained.             16:44:31

                15           And the third one, which is called on    16:44:35

                16   the sheet that we have in front of us 2$, is     16:44:38

                17   the program of record risk adjusted with the     16:44:41

                18   plussed up budget trend that Sally discussed.    16:44:44

                19           So, in fact, there're three versions of  16:44:46

                20   the program of record -- unconstrained,          16:44:50

                21   constrained within the President's budget, and   16:44:53

                22   constrained within this curve that we've         16:44:57

                23   sketched in as what might be a reasonable        16:45:00

                24   increase over the proposed budget.               16:45:03

                25           The next one is 3B, which is ISS         16:45:06





                                                               192



                 1   Focused, commercial crew, because as Sally       16:45:12

                 2   pointed out, the ISS Focused Ares I option       16:45:15

                 3   just didn't make any sense because in            16:45:20

                 4   the Close the ISS in '15, the Ares I becomes     16:45:27

                 5   available in about '16 and in the Close the      16:45:33

                 6   ISS in '20, the Ares I becomes available in      16:45:33

                 7   about '19, just in enough time to see the end    16:45:35

                 8   of the space station.  So there is no budget     16:45:38

                 9   scenario in which trying to build the ISS        16:45:41

                10   (sic) in order to make it to the space           16:45:46

                11   station makes sense if you have to pay for       16:45:48

                12   the space station to keep it alive out of the    16:45:55

                13   same budget.                                     16:45:55

                14           Is that a fair statement, Sally?         16:45:55

                15           DR. RIDE:  Yeah, it is.                  16:46:01

                16           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  So what we've       16:46:01

                17   done is we've taken out of the variant of ISS    16:46:01

                18   Focused with Ares I and left in the ISS          16:46:06

                19   Focused with commercial crew, which does show    16:46:11

                20   on Sally's chart of an hour or two ago the       16:46:11

                21   commercial crew access to the ISS by '16 or      16:46:11

                22   so, sometime in the middle of the decade.        16:46:14

                23           Now, this is color-coded to this last    16:46:21

                24   chart, which the committee has, by the way,      16:46:27

                25   from earlier this afternoon.  The light blue     16:46:27





                                                               193



                 1   on this references back to the light blue on     16:46:34

                 2   Chart 28 of my earlier presentation.  The        16:46:34

                 3   yellow references back to Chart 29 of the        16:46:40

                 4   previous presentation.  And the green            16:46:40

                 5   references back to Chart 30 of the previous      16:46:46

                 6   presentation, which were the families that I     16:46:46

                 7   described.                                       16:46:50

                 8           So if we look at the yellow one,         16:46:50

                 9   these are basically all of the variants of       16:46:54

                10   Deep Space, not all of which Sally had the       16:46:59

                11   opportunity to present but which are in          16:46:59

                12   consideration, which are basically the           16:47:07

                13   Deep Space with the Ares V Lite, which are       16:47:07

                14   the sixes, the Deep Space with the commercial    16:47:07

                15   hydrocarbon booster, which are the sevens,       16:47:16

                16   and the Deep Space with the shuttle-derived      16:47:16

                17   vehicle, which we called 7S.                     16:47:16

                18           (Discussion off the record.)             16:47:16

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  And then in each of        16:47:27

                20   those there's an unconstrained budget and a      16:47:27

                21   plus-up budget, indicated by the little extra    16:47:34

                22   dollar sign after the number.                    16:47:34

                23           And then finally there are the last      16:47:34

                24   three in the green family, which is the          16:47:42

                25   alternate Mars forward exploration of the        16:47:42





                                                               194



                 1   Moon or the Mars First ones, 8 was the Lunar     16:47:42

                 2   Global with Ares V Lite, 9 was Lunar Global      16:47:48

                 3   with the commercial hydrocarbon and 10 was       16:47:52

                 4   Mars First with the unconstrained budget.        16:47:52

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Ed, which one of         16:47:57

                 6   these would be the one that would go above       16:47:57

                 7   the $3 billion that Sally described that         16:48:02

                 8   might go to $4 billion or $5 billion or          16:48:02

                 9   something like that?                             16:48:06

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, we haven't done      16:48:06

                11   yet that sort of second-order sensitivity,       16:48:11

                12   Norm.  We've got, for most of them --            16:48:11

                13           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Should we add one to     16:48:18

                14   do that?  I hate to be adding but -- either      16:48:18

                15   replace one of these or add.  It sounds like     16:48:18

                16   it's an add.                                     16:48:28

                17           DR. CRAWLEY:  I would interpret the      16:48:28

                18   plus-up ones as still having some --             16:48:28

                19           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Latitude to work on      16:48:28

                20   them?                                            16:48:28

                21           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- latitude --             16:48:39

                22           MR. AUGUSTINE:  That's fine.             16:48:39

                23           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- as to how much we're    16:48:39

                24   going to plus it up.                             16:48:39

                25           MR. AUGUSTINE:  So it's not              16:48:39





                                                               195



                 1   necessarily the $3 billion number?               16:48:39

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  It's not exactly the       16:48:39

                 3   number.                                          16:48:39

                 4           Would you agree with that, Sally.        16:48:39

                 5           DR. RIDE:  Absolutely.  You know, we     16:48:39

                 6   picked that number, you know, late Saturday      16:48:50

                 7   night sometime, I think, and --                  16:48:50

                 8           MR. AUGUSTINE:  So this falls in the     16:48:50

                 9   category of just an updating the basic           16:48:50

                10   options that you defined?                        16:48:50

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  Rather than        16:49:05

                12   defining a new option.                           16:49:05

                13           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Fine.                    16:49:05

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  And one of the things      16:49:05

                15   we did want to go back -- and I think we've      16:49:05

                16   almost done now -- is to compare that with       16:49:05

                17   some of the earlier budgets just to see --       16:49:05

                18   early budget guidances just to see how it        16:49:05

                19   compared.                                        16:49:18

                20           So I would interpret these plus-up       16:49:18

                21   ones as still have some margin to -- what        16:49:18

                22   Norm is referring to is there are some of        16:49:18

                23   these where we have a sense that if we move      16:49:31

                24   the budget request up just a bit more it         16:49:31

                25   would have a significant influence on            16:49:31





                                                               196



                 1   accelerating key milestones in the future and    16:49:31

                 2   that before we make the final recommendation     16:49:31

                 3   to the White House we might want to do that      16:49:46

                 4   sensitivity analysis.  You know, if we can       16:49:46

                 5   buy a year or two for a modest increase in       16:49:46

                 6   the earlier years, that's probably a trade       16:49:46

                 7   worth making.                                    16:49:46

                 8           Does that answer your question, Norm?    16:50:02

                 9           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  Thank you.        16:50:02

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  Now, what you might be     16:50:02

                11   able to, see if you read across, are the,        16:50:02

                12   now, 13 evaluation criteria which Wanda just     16:50:02

                13   went through.                                    16:50:16

                14           And I'll read from right -- from left    16:50:16

                15   to right for those who can't read --             16:50:16

                16   Exploration Preparation, Technology              16:50:16

                17   Innovation, Science Knowledge, Human             16:50:16

                18   Civilization, Economic Expansion, Public         16:50:23

                19   Engagement and Global Partners, which are the    16:50:23

                20   seven areas of defined benefit.  Then there's    16:50:23

                21   Sustainability, Safety and Mission Success,      16:50:28

                22   NASA/Industry Workforce and National Skills,     16:50:33

                23   which are the -- call them programmatic          16:50:33

                24   considerations.                                  16:50:35

                25           And then I've left blank the Schedule    16:50:35





                                                               197



                 1   and Program Risk and the Life Cycle Cost         16:50:38

                 2   because that information is really derived       16:50:41

                 3   from the Aerospace costing analysis rather       16:50:44

                 4   than an independent pass through the problem.    16:50:48

                 5   I mean, there's no sense filling that in         16:50:53

                 6   without having all of the -- it's a way to       16:50:56

                 7   report in this format what the cost and          16:51:01

                 8   schedule information from the Aerospace          16:51:01

                 9   analysis would show.                             16:51:08

                10           So I suggest, Norm, that we just         16:51:08

                11   defer those two until we're able to see the      16:51:08

                12   details of the analysis and focus on the         16:51:13

                13   remaining 11 of them which is not a small        16:51:13

                14   number.                                          16:51:18

                15           MR. GREASON:  I want another option      16:51:18

                16   like I want a hole in the head.  But what        16:51:24

                17   happened to Scenario 5?                          16:51:24

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  Scenario 5...              16:51:30

                19           MR. GREASON:  That was the -- that       16:51:30

                20   was the shuttle extension.                       16:51:30

                21           DR. RIDE:  Shuttle extension.            16:51:30

                22           DR. CRAWLEY:  It was one of the ones     16:51:35

                23   with the red line through it that --             16:51:35

                24           MR. GREASON:  Okay.  Well, I --          16:51:39

                25           MR. AUGUSTINE:  It should be here.       16:51:39





                                                               198



                 1           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  I think --             16:51:39

                 2           MR. GREASON:  I mean --                  16:51:39

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  Oh, okay.                  16:51:42

                 4           MR. GREASON:  -- I'm actually not in     16:51:42

                 5   favor of this option.  I'm just trying to see    16:51:44

                 6   that they get their due.                         16:51:46

                 7           DR. CRAWLEY:  I was under the            16:51:46

                 8   impression that it was another one that when     16:51:48

                 9   the analysis was done that the shuttle           16:51:50

                10   extension cost caused the availability of the    16:51:52

                11   shuttle-derived vehicle to move enough to the    16:51:55

                12   left that you were recommending not              16:51:57

                13   continuing it.                                   16:51:59

                14           DR. RIDE:  No.                           16:51:59

                15           DR. CRAWLEY:  But if I misunderstood,    16:52:01

                16   I'll be happy to add it back in.                 16:52:04

                17           DR. RIDE:  Actually we haven't gotten    16:52:07

                18   the constrained -- or the partially              16:52:07

                19   constrained, less constrained, plus up --        16:52:15

                20   whatever we want to call it -- budget for        16:52:15

                21   that one yet, and, you know, I think that        16:52:15

                22   there were some mitigating circumstances that    16:52:22

                23   we wanted to take a look at.                     16:52:28

                24           MR. GREASON:  Okay.                      16:52:28

                25           DR. RIDE:  We pushed it down on the      16:52:28





                                                               199



                 1   priority stack to get some of the other runs     16:52:28

                 2   out, but I don't think we've fully --            16:52:34

                 3           MR. GREASON:  Okay.                      16:52:34

                 4           DR. RIDE:  -- come full circle on        16:52:43

                 5   that one yet.                                    16:52:43

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  So we'll put it     16:52:43

                 7   back in between 3 and 6, which raises the        16:52:43

                 8   question of what was 4.                          16:52:49

                 9           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah, it does.  What     16:52:49

                10   was 4?                                           16:52:49

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  The 4 was Dash Out of      16:52:49

                12   LEO, and we discussed that one.                  16:52:52

                13           DR. RIDE:  Dash Out of LEO, yeah.        16:52:52

                14           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I'm sorry.  What was     16:52:54

                15   4?                                               16:52:54

                16           DR. CRAWLEY:  Dash out of LEO.  And      16:52:54

                17   3A was the ISS Focused with the Ares V crew.     16:52:57

                18           DR. CHIAO:  Ares I.                      16:52:59

                19           DR. RIDE:  Ares I.                       16:52:59

                22           Thank you.                               16:53:01

                23           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think one thing,       16:53:01

                24   Ed, about this is that although we've got a      16:53:03

                25   ton of options, which I didn't want to do, a     16:53:06





                                                               200



                 1   lot of them can be dismissed almost              16:53:11

                 2   immediately.  So I think we show them because    16:53:11

                 3   there are people who are interested in           16:53:16

                 4   them --                                          16:53:16

                 5           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     16:53:16

                 6           MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- but not because       16:53:16

                 7   they're worthy of a great deal of thought.       16:53:20

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     16:53:20

                 9           MR. GREASON:  Maybe we should go         16:53:26

                10   through that exercise so we don't spend out      16:53:26

                11   time and energy scoring options so that we       16:53:26

                12   can delete them.                                 16:53:26

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  Let me just say    16:53:29

                14   one more sentence.                               16:53:29

                15           Because in a FACA process, it's          16:53:31

                16   important to explain how this document in        16:53:34

                17   front of you was derived -- and then I think     16:53:36

                18   we should have that discussion, Norm -- which    16:53:38

                19   is that a subgroup of the overall committee      16:53:39

                20   deliberated -- many of them being as domain      16:53:43

                21   experts on various columns -- so that, for       16:53:46

                22   example, we worked with Wanda on the Safety      16:53:49

                23   and Mission Success, with Leroy on Human         16:53:53

                24   Civilization and Global Partnerships and         16:53:56

                25   Safety, with Chris on Science, with Jeff on      16:53:59





                                                               201



                 1   Exploration Preparation and Technology           16:54:04

                 2   Innovation.                                      16:54:07

                 3           So this is a summing together of the     16:54:09

                 4   individual contributions with a little           16:54:11

                 5   adjusting by me in order to present a            16:54:13

                 6   proposal to the group here for deliberation      16:54:15

                 7   in public.                                       16:54:19

                 8           MR. BEJMUK:  Norm, may I ask you a       16:54:22

                 9   question?                                        16:54:23

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  Oh, can I just add one     16:54:25

                11   more thing --                                    16:54:28

                12           MR. BEJMUK:  Sure.                       16:54:28

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- is that, as a ground    16:54:29

                14   rule, what I'd like to suggest is that in        16:54:29

                15   this sort of subjective evaluation there's       16:54:32

                16   pretty good social science research that         16:54:36

                17   indicates that if you give people a              16:54:36

                18   five-point scale to rate on that's even          16:54:39

                19   with -- attached to rubrics, like the ones       16:54:41

                20   Wanda produced, a difference of one increment    16:54:43

                21   is essentially agreement.                        16:54:45

                22           In other words, Leroy and I could        16:54:48

                23   argue all day whether a given number is --       16:54:50

                24   should be minus one or minus two, the real       16:54:52

                25   disagreements occur if I think it should be      16:54:56





                                                               202



                 1   minus one and he thinks it should be plus        16:54:58

                 2   one.                                             16:54:58

                 3           So what I would do, as we're             16:54:58

                 4   reviewing this, is look for places where you     16:55:02

                 5   think the grading is off by more than one        16:55:08

                 6   increment as the places that are really          16:55:08

                 7   important to discuss.                            16:55:16

                 8           I'm sorry, Bo.                           16:55:16

                 9           MR. BEJMUK:  The question I was going    16:55:16

                10   to ask -- Norm, would you like us to dialogue    16:55:16

                11   this, or do each one of us change the            16:55:16

                12   numbers and somebody treats it as a voting?      16:55:24

                13           MR. AUGUSTINE:  No.  I think I would     16:55:24

                14   rather dialogue it, and I think, as Ed goes      16:55:33

                15   through, we'll just pick those areas where we    16:55:33

                16   have a two-point difference or something         16:55:33

                17   profound and with the understanding that as      16:55:44

                18   we get new data -- we're still collecting        16:55:44

                19   data obviously -- it may change these but it     16:55:44

                20   will be based on fact.                           16:55:44

                21           MR. BEJMUK:  Well, because, for          16:55:44

                22   example, I was looking at why is Technology      16:55:44

                23   Innovation two for hydrocarbon booster?          16:55:44

                24           MR. GREASON:  Because those options      16:55:58

                25   have propellant transfer integral to them,       16:56:02





                                                               203



                 1   and so we pull that capability in --             16:56:04

                 2           DR. CHYBA:  So is propellant transfer    16:56:04

                 3   marked --                                        16:56:05

                 4           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, and it would         16:56:05

                 5   stimulate an order of $2 billion investment      16:56:08

                 6   in the development of a new large hydrocarbon    16:56:10

                 7   engine, which is currently not differentially    16:56:15

                 8   cost --                                          16:56:18

                 9           MR. BEJMUK:  But it's not                16:56:19

                10   propulsion -- kerosene and LOX propulsion, is    16:56:24

                11   it?  Because we are either buying Russian        16:56:25

                12   engines or doing what Russians have done for     16:56:29

                13   decades and I would hardly call that             16:56:29

                14   innovation.                                      16:56:30

                15           MR. GREASON:  Yeah.  In my opinion,      16:56:32

                16   it's not the hydrocarbon propulsion, it's the    16:56:33

                17   reliance on propellant transfer that's the       16:56:36

                18   big swinger.                                     16:56:36

                19           MR. BEJMUK:  Okay.  Well, I -- that I    16:56:36

                20   can live with.  Okay.  Thank you.                16:56:40

                21           MR. AUGUSTINE:  You know, I wonder if    16:56:40

                22   we shouldn't go through these in sequence --     16:56:42

                23           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     16:56:42

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- and talk about        16:56:44

                25   them, and I would do it by column.               16:56:47





                                                               204



                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  So we'll start      16:56:49

                 2   with the first one.                              16:56:53

                 3           DR. RIDE:  Ed, can I go back to          16:56:53

                 4   Norm's question about -- or maybe it was your    16:56:57

                 5   question about --                                16:57:01

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  Should we take some        16:57:01

                 7   rows off?                                        16:57:01

                 8           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  Should we take some    16:57:01

                 9   rows off --                                      16:57:01

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.                      16:57:01

                11           DR. RIDE:  -- like the unconstrained     16:57:01

                12   rows?                                            16:57:04

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     16:57:04

                14           DR. RIDE:  I mean, are we really         16:57:04

                15   considering unconstrained?                       16:57:09

                16           MR. GREASON:  That's a good question.    16:57:09

                17   I don't know the answer to that question.        16:57:16

                18   Maybe Norm does.                                 16:57:16

                19           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Maybe he does.           16:57:16

                20           DR. RIDE:  I didn't show any of the      16:57:23

                21   constrained budgets but --                       16:57:23

                22           MR. GREASON:  I have another cut that    16:57:23

                23   we might be able to make more easily, which      16:57:30

                24   is I'd like to suggest, given everything         16:57:30

                25   we've heard and everything we've learned,        16:57:30





                                                               205



                 1   that however painful the budgetary               16:57:30

                 2   implications may be we just face up to the       16:57:30

                 3   fact that ISS is not going to splash in 2016     16:57:37

                 4   and we just admit it and we just take the        16:57:44

                 5   options that rely on ISS splashing in 2016       16:57:44

                 6   off the table.                                   16:57:44

                 7           DR. RIDE:  I can agree with that.        16:57:54

                 8           MR. GREASON:  Ed?  I mean, you're --     16:57:54

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  I'm just flipping          16:57:54

                10   through my notes here.                           16:57:54

                11           DR. CHYBA:  Other than program of        16:57:54

                12   record, which we --                              16:58:00

                13           MR. GREASON:  Well, actually I think     16:58:00

                14   the implication of that would be that the        16:58:00

                15   program of record would be only there for        16:58:00

                16   purposes of comparison.                          16:58:03

                17           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         16:58:08

                18           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Should we show one       16:58:08

                19   option that does not continue ISS so it shows    16:58:10

                20   the impact of not continuing it?                 16:58:14

                21           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, actually as of       16:58:17

                22   now, having taken Dash Out of LEO off for        16:58:21

                23   reasons that it didn't achieve its purposes,     16:58:23

                24   the only option that ends the ISS in 2015 is     16:58:27

                25   the program of record, and I think one of the    16:58:29





                                                               206



                 1   agreements we had -- or one of the thoughts      16:58:33

                 2   we had is that we would show the program of      16:58:38

                 3   record if it -- at least for a reference case    16:58:38

                 4   but we could go either way on that or we         16:58:46

                 5   could just change the ISS date in the program    16:58:52

                 6   of record to 2020.                               16:58:52

                 7           DR. RIDE:  Well, actually I was going    16:58:57

                 8   to propose that possibility.  That we've been    16:58:57

                 9   dealing with the program of record as a          16:58:57

                10   baseline, you know, a comparison case, I'm       16:59:04

                11   wondering whether, almost for completeness,      16:59:04

                12   we should consider one that is the program of    16:59:11

                13   record with the ISS and with the technology      16:59:11

                14   line included.                                   16:59:16

                15           You know, we've got the -- the           16:59:20

                16   program of record does not include the robust    16:59:20

                17   technology line.  I'm sure none of us would      16:59:24

                18   think that that would be the right way to        16:59:28

                19   continue forward, even if we went forward        16:59:28

                20   with the program of record.                      16:59:31

                21           And it doesn't include the ISS           16:59:31

                22   extension, and I think, if we want to keep       16:59:34

                23   one without -- you know, that splashes the       16:59:39

                24   ISS, then, you know, we sort of have one in      16:59:39

                25   our baseline program of record.                  16:59:44





                                                               207



                 1           But I'd actually be in favor of not      16:59:44

                 2   keeping -- not keeping an option that            16:59:49

                 3   de-orbits the ISS just for the sake of having    16:59:52

                 4   an option that de-orbits the ISS.                16:59:55

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  I'm doing a       17:00:00

                 6   flip-flop here.  I've been the one all along     17:00:00

                 7   that's been arguing for fewer options.           17:00:04

                 8           But there is a substantial body of       17:00:04

                 9   people that believe you ought to shut ISS        17:00:09

                10   down and get on with life, spend your money      17:00:11

                11   on new systems.  Most everybody I talked to      17:00:15

                12   from the science community feels that way.       17:00:18

                13   And if we don't even have that option in         17:00:21

                14   here, it's going to raise a lot of questions.    17:00:23

                15           Also I think, although all of us         17:00:27

                16   agree you should add the technology program,     17:00:29

                17   the fact of life is that it's not in the         17:00:33

                18   current program of reference.  So it's really    17:00:38

                19   not a program of reference if we add it to       17:00:44

                20   it.                                              17:00:44

                21           You know, I don't know.  It's a tough    17:00:44

                22   call, but my leaning would be to keep a pure     17:00:44

                23   program of reference and live with more          17:00:52

                24   options.                                         17:00:52

                25           MR. GREASON:  My suggestion actually     17:00:52





                                                               208



                 1   is we leave the program of record options in     17:00:52

                 2   but we state fairly clearly they are there       17:01:01

                 3   for reference and all of our going forward       17:01:01

                 4   suggestions are below that triple line.          17:01:01

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, I had thought      17:01:05

                 6   of that too.  You don't even count those.        17:01:05

                 7   Yeah.  Those are -- we're saying that they're    17:01:10

                 8   not doable, they're for reference.               17:01:10

                 9           MR. GREASON:  Okay.                      17:01:10

                10           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I like that.             17:01:13

                11           DR. RIDE:  But then I guess that I'd     17:01:13

                12   ask whether -- you know, by the end of the       17:01:18

                13   day, are we going to try to reduce this          17:01:18

                14   number of scenarios some through whatever        17:01:22

                15   deliberations and wisdom we want to apply, or    17:01:26

                16   are we planning to come out of today with,       17:01:31

                17   you know, sort of a broad set of scenarios       17:01:35

                18   that we intend to carry forward?                 17:01:37

                19           You know, the question is, at some       17:01:42

                20   level, whether we think we need -- you know,     17:01:45

                21   we're at the stage where we can, you know,       17:01:47

                22   talk about whether we think we need to have      17:01:49

                23   an option that de-orbits the ISS in the          17:01:52

                24   options that we take forward to the decision     17:01:58

                25   makers.                                          17:02:00

                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, let me comment,      17:02:00

                 2   Norm, that another -- because it's a coupled     17:02:02

                 3   idea, another desire that we have is to show     17:02:06

                 4   at least two options that are actually in        17:02:12

                 5   guidance.                                        17:02:14

                 6           MR. AUGUSTINE:  That are actually        17:02:15

                 7   what?                                            17:02:17

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  That are within the        17:02:17

                 9   budget guidance.                                 17:02:21

                10           MR. AUGUSTINE:  We've got to do that.    17:02:22

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  And almost certainly       17:02:24

                12   one of those could be the program of record,     17:02:26

                13   splashing the ISS and executing the program      17:02:30

                14   as rapidly as it would fit within the budget,    17:02:30

                15   which I think is --                              17:02:34

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  That's another           17:02:34

                17   important point.                                 17:02:36

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     17:02:37

                19           MR. GREASON:  So 2 and 3B are the        17:02:39

                20   only ones we have right now that fall into       17:02:41

                21   that category.                                   17:02:44

                22           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  Two and -- yes.    17:02:41

                23   That's right.                                    17:02:46

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  2 and 3B meet the --     17:02:46

                25           DR. CRAWLEY:  2 and 3B -- we were        17:02:46





                                                               210



                 1   carrying three, you'll recall, that we           17:02:49

                 2   thought would look not as bad as others          17:02:51

                 3   within the budget constraint, and one of         17:02:56

                 4   them, which was the Dash Out of Leo, really      17:02:57

                 5   didn't make any sense.                           17:03:00

                 6           So the two that we have that are         17:03:01

                 7   likely within budget or can be made to be        17:03:03

                 8   within budget are the program of record          17:03:08

                 9   without the ISS extension and the ISS Focused    17:03:09

                10   which has the ISS extension.  So it sort of      17:03:13

                11   represents the two cases of, you know, how       17:03:18

                12   fast you can do anything within the budget,      17:03:21

                13   turning off the ISS or leaving the ISS on for    17:03:26

                14   another give years.                              17:03:30

                15           So that would argue we should keep 2     17:03:30

                16   and 3B to satisfy the commitment we've made      17:03:34

                17   to the White House to present options within     17:03:37

                18   budget guidance.                                 17:03:40

                19           MR. GREASON:  Well, I'm not again --     17:03:41

                20   I'm not in favor of fewer options just for       17:03:42

                21   the sake of few options.  But, you know, even    17:03:42

                22   I, who's been living with this for a long        17:03:46

                23   time, feel like we've got too many things on     17:03:48

                24   the Chinese menu.                                17:03:51

                25           What about taking off Lunar Global?      17:03:55





                                                               211



                 1           DR. CHIAO:  Certainly the                17:03:58

                 2   unconstrained versions of Lunar Global.  It      17:04:01

                 3   looks a lot like program of record.              17:04:01

                 4           MR. GREASON:  And it's just not          17:04:02

                 5   obvious that from a national -- I mean, let's    17:04:02

                 6   not kid ourselves.  We cannot design, you        17:04:03

                 7   know, right down to the manifest and the         17:04:07

                 8   system design and what all of the pieces are     17:04:10

                 9   anything.                                        17:04:13

                10           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I could get with         17:04:13

                11   that.                                            17:04:15

                12           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         17:04:15

                13           MR. GREASON:  And so we're talking       17:04:15

                14   about giving broad-brush guidance, and it's      17:04:18

                15   not -- it's pretty obvious that in a world of    17:04:22

                16   constrained budgets, even though we may do a     17:04:24

                17   lunar lander, it's not going to be Altair.       17:04:30

                18   You know, the bunny is not there.                17:04:33

                19           DR. CHIAO:  Well, along those lines,     17:04:37

                20   I mean, what about all of the unconstrained      17:04:37

                21   budgets like the ones in yellow?                 17:04:41

                22           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        17:04:41

                23           DR. AUSTIN:  I heard that suggestion     17:04:41

                24   earlier, and I think that -- you know, I         17:04:41

                25   thought we had consensus that taking             17:04:41

                 1   something forward that is unconstrained and,     17:04:47

                 2   you know, doesn't factor in the realities of     17:04:47

                 3   the, you know, budget --                         17:04:53

                 4           MR. GREASON:  Right.                     17:04:53

                 5           DR. AUSTIN:  -- implications -- which    17:04:53

                 6   would not do well overseas, so...                17:04:53

                 7           DR. CHIAO:  We can leave the program     17:04:53

                 8   of record unconstrained just for reference.      17:04:53

                 9           MR. GREASON:  Okay.                      17:04:53

                10           DR. RIDE:  But then to leave all of      17:04:53

                11   the other unconstrained --                       17:04:53

                12           DR. CHIAO:  You have to leave all of     17:04:53

                13   the other unconstrained.                         17:05:04

                14           MR. GREASON:  And then we might have     17:05:04

                15   a second order of discussion -- some of          17:05:04

                16   these, I think -- Norm already said some of      17:05:04

                17   these might want to be constrained to a          17:05:08

                18   little bit higher number, and I think there's    17:05:10

                19   one that we might want to look at constrained    17:05:12

                20   to a little bit lower number.  But that's a      17:05:16

                21   nuance.                                          17:05:20

                22           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  That is, I        17:05:20

                23   think, a nuance for our purpose.  If you get     17:05:20

                24   rid of lunar -- I would have no problem          17:05:28

                25   getting rid of Lunar Global given what we now    17:05:28





                                                               213



                 1   know.                                            17:05:28

                 2           Is there anybody who would argue for     17:05:28

                 3   keeping Lunar Global?                            17:05:28

                 4           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, I'm just being --    17:05:35

                 5   one of the things that is making the             17:05:35

                 6   appearance of it being desirable to get rid      17:05:35

                 7   of Lunar Global is that the only two cases       17:05:44

                 8   we've actually run are both -- are the           17:05:44

                 9   unconstrained ones.                              17:05:44

                10           So if you just sort of read down the     17:05:44

                11   list and say let's get rid of the                17:05:44

                12   unconstrained ones, that ends up X'ing out       17:05:44

                13   both of the Lunar Globals.                       17:05:51

                14           So what I'm doing, Norm, is I'm just     17:06:00

                15   running my eye along the line 8 and the          17:06:00

                16   line 1 -- which, if it were true that these      17:06:00

                17   were the same program, would have about the      17:06:00

                18   same scores -- and there's a few places where    17:06:07

                19   they're different and I'm trying to              17:06:07

                20   reconstruct in realtime why.                     17:06:13

                21           But you see there are other things       17:06:13

                22   like in 8, in fact, the ISS continues whereas    17:06:16

                23   in the POR it doesn't, right, and in 8           17:06:23

                24   there's the technology wedge, which in 1         17:06:23

                25   there isn't.                                     17:06:23





                                                               214



                 1           So, in fact, if you -- I think that      17:06:35

                 2   the way we've done the bookkeeping, 8 is --      17:06:35

                 3   not that I'm fighting taking -- getting rid      17:06:35

                 4   of Lunar Global, but 8 is actually a better      17:06:35

                 5   proxy for what we think the program of record    17:06:48

                 6   would look like if we put the ISS extension      17:06:48

                 7   in and we put the technology wedge in, if you    17:06:48

                 8   follow that.                                     17:06:48

                 9           MR. McALISTER:  But it's even worse      17:07:01

                10   though.                                          17:07:01

                11           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         17:07:01

                12           MR. McALISTER:  It's even worse than     17:07:01

                13   the program of record though.                    17:07:01

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, it's even worse      17:07:01

                15   in what sense?                                   17:07:01

                16           MR. McALISTER:  It pushes everything     17:07:01

                17   further out.                                     17:07:01

                18           MR. GREASON:  Well, we don't know        17:07:01

                19   that yet.  There's a lot of -- there's a big     17:07:01

                20   question mark on some of the -- one of the       17:07:08

                21   cost numbers --                                  17:07:08

                22           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         17:07:08

                23           MR. GREASON:  -- that's a big driver     17:07:08

                24   on that chart.                                   17:07:08

                25           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.                      17:07:08

                 1           MR. GREASON:  But what I do think --     17:07:08

                 2   versus program of record is not so obvious.      17:07:16

                 3   But when you compare Lunar Global to             17:07:16

                 4   Deep Space, it is obvious.                       17:07:16

                 5           DR. CRAWLEY:  That's right.              17:07:16

                 6           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.                    17:07:16

                 7           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         17:07:16

                 8           MR. GREASON:  You know, the --           17:07:16

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  You know, I would take     17:07:16

                10   the -- you know, correcting for this change      17:07:22

                11   of the ISS and the technology line, I would      17:07:22

                12   take the friendly amendment that Jeff has        17:07:27

                13   proposed, that -- I think that the creation      17:07:29

                14   of Lunar Global was an attempt to see if sort    17:07:29

                15   of a different strategy for exploring the        17:07:37

                16   Moon would produce significantly different       17:07:40

                17   value or significantly different cost, and I     17:07:40

                18   think that in the first approximation it         17:07:42

                19   didn't.                                          17:07:49

                20           So that at the sort of -- I wish it      17:07:49

                21   were down as low as 30,000 feet -- 100,000       17:07:49

                10   thought about this --                            17:08:13

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     17:08:13

                18   completely fair and open, the actual program     17:08:25

                19   of record -- the guys in Houston who think       17:08:28

                20   about this every day -- still have, you know,    17:08:31

                21   variants that are not dissimilar from            17:08:33

                22   Deep Space within the trade space they're        17:08:37

                 1   we would not -- we would not lose anything by    17:08:46

                 2   taking those off.                                17:08:52

                 7           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.                    17:09:07

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  Before we do the           17:09:07

                 9   bookkeeping, let's talk about Option 10.         17:09:07

                10           MR. GREASON:  That's the caveat.         17:09:12

                11           DR. RIDE:  That's the one, yeah.         17:09:12

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  Dr. Ride, do you want      17:09:12

                13   to talk to us about Option 10?                   17:09:18

                14           DR. RIDE:  I'm not sure.  I think        17:09:18

                15   that, you know, from the perspective that        17:09:21

                16   we've had just in the last four days where       17:09:21

                17   we've been focused on the numbers and trying     17:09:29

                18   to see whether these fit under any reasonable    17:09:29

                19   budget assumption over the next few years, we    17:09:35

                20   have not done the runs yet, so we don't know     17:09:37

                21   how bad this is, but just knowing the            17:09:41

                22   elements that built it up and the numbers        17:09:45

                23   that go into the elements that built it up,      17:09:48

                24   it's pretty clear that it's going to be worse    17:09:51

                25   in a budget sense -- probably considerably       17:09:53





                                                               218



                 1   worse than any of the budgets that we've         17:09:56

                 2   looked at.                                       17:10:01

                 3           I think just a rough order of            17:10:02

                 4   magnitude that some of the NASA folks have       17:10:05

                 5   been carrying around in their heads is that      17:10:10

                 6   it's about a factor of two more than the         17:10:14

                 7   program of record, and, you know, for our        17:10:16

                 8   purposes today, that's not a horrible number     17:10:19

                 9   to be using.                                     17:10:22

                10           So I think the decision that we have     17:10:26

                11   to make on this particular one is whether we     17:10:26

                12   want to consider it on the merits of the         17:10:31

                13   option independent of how much it costs or       17:10:31

                14   whether we want to say right now it is -- you    17:10:36

                15   know, it's just quite a ways outside -- I        17:10:41

                16   mean, it's way outside of the budget guidance    17:10:44

                17   that we've been given so we could take it off    17:10:47

                18   the table.                                       17:10:51

                19           And I actually don't have -- I'm not     17:10:52

                20   sure I have an opinion on that --                17:10:56

                21           MR. AUGUSTINE:  You know, Sally --       17:10:56

                22           DR. RIDE:  -- on that yet.  I almost     17:10:59

                23   hate to get rid of it at this stage.             17:11:01

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  My leaning would be      17:11:04

                25   to carry items that have merit.  And if --       17:11:05





                                                               219



                 1   the decision maker will go to the life cycle     17:11:09

                 2   cost column first and go down to it and cross    17:11:09

                 3   out the big ones and immediately focus on the    17:11:11

                 4   ones that are left.  So I don't think they're    17:11:14

                 5   going to wind up with ten items to consider.     17:11:20

                 6           MR. GREASON:  Well, I'd like to          17:11:24

                 7   discuss the merit of that option.                17:11:24

                 8           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Go ahead.                17:11:24

                 9           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         17:11:24

                10           MR. GREASON:  You know, I have           17:11:28

                11   dreamed of going to Mars my whole life, and I    17:11:33

                12   think the most destructive thing that we         17:11:36

                13   could do as a nation that would put the          17:11:36

                14   chance of actually extending human               17:11:38

                15   civilization to Mars off for a generation, if    17:11:40

                16   not forever, would be to do a headlong rush      17:11:44

                17   to Mars right now.  And the reason for that      17:11:51

                18   is, you know, look at where we are now with      17:11:51

                19   the Moon.                                        17:11:54

                20           You know, smart people who've            17:11:57

                21   followed this program their entire lives are     17:11:58

                22   saying we can never do anything to make it       17:12:00

                23   affordable to go to the Moon because we know     17:12:04

                24   how that's going to be done and it's very        17:12:08

                25   expensive.  Now, I don't agree with that.        17:12:12





                                                               220



                 1   But that's the result.  That's what happens      17:12:17

                 2   when you go a bridge too far and you say,        17:12:17

                 3   never mind what it costs, you know, let's        17:12:24

                 4   just do it.                                      17:12:24

                 5           And if we go to Mars in a hurry with     17:12:24

                 6   the technology that we have today, with the      17:12:32

                 7   architectures that we have today, with the       17:12:32

                 8   lack of time and investment to develop the       17:12:32

                 9   in-space infrastructure that we would need to    17:12:38

                10   do this in an affordable way, it's literally     17:12:38

                11   $2 billion per footprint, never mind the         17:12:47

                12   development costs, the recurring costs, you      17:12:50

                13   know.  And I simply can't believe that for a     17:12:55

                14   generation we're going to sustain that and       17:12:56

                15   then when we get there not say, great,           17:12:59

                16   mission accomplished, there's always a next      17:13:01

                17   election, you know, let's stop.  And that        17:13:02

                18   would be a disaster.                             17:13:05

                19           So I don't think that the option of      17:13:05

                20   going there this way -- I want to go to Mars     17:13:08

                21   but not this way.  I want to go to Mars the      17:13:12

                22   right way, which is let's invest in the          17:13:16

                23   buildup of infrastructure, let's invest in       17:13:20

                24   the buildup of transportation, let's invest      17:13:26

                25   in the buildup of technology so that we have     17:13:26





                                                               221



                 1   some idea of how we actually want to do it.      17:13:26

                 2           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Let me play -- well,     17:13:34

                 3   go ahead, Chris.  Then I'd like to play the      17:13:34

                 4   devil's advocate.                                17:13:34

                 5           DR. CHYBA:  Thank you.  I'm              17:13:34

                 6   comfortable with where we're coming out, but     17:13:34

                 7   I want to make a kind of brief summary           17:13:42

                 8   statement to actually test whether I'm           17:13:42

                 9   comfortable with it.                             17:13:48

                10           What we're about to do, as we're         17:13:48

                11   going down this direction, is to say to the      17:13:48

                12   White House that, okay, you've got the           17:13:48

                13   program of record scenarios for reference,       17:13:56

                14   those involve a robust lunar program but, you

                15   know, they all look absurd, they're either

                16   way outside of the budget guidance or you

                17   don't actually do anything within the time

                18   scales we're looking at, Lunar Global and

                19   Mars, they either look like the program of

                20   record or Mars is impossible within, you         17:14:08

                21   know, twice the budget of the program of         17:14:09

                22   record.                                          17:14:11

                23           So basically all of the options we're    17:14:11

                24   going to present to the White House are          17:14:14

                25   Deep Space options.  Now, admittedly they        17:14:16





                                                               222



                 1   have off-ramps for lunar surface exploration.    17:14:21

                 2   But basically -- here are your options,          17:14:24

                 3   they're Deep Space options, oh, and by the       17:14:24

                 4   way, we've taken Ares I off of the table.        17:14:27

                 5           I just want to make it clear that        17:14:33

                 6   we're -- you know, in terms of presenting        17:14:33

                 7   options to the White House, in some sense,       17:14:38

                 8   we're presenting a fairly limited suite of       17:14:38

                 9   options to them.                                 17:14:38

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  I don't think that's       17:14:44

                11   factually quite correct, Chris.                  17:14:44

                12           DR. CHYBA:  Great.  Correct me.          17:14:44

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  I think that what we've    17:14:48

                14   agreed -- at least in my notes, Norm -- is       17:14:48

                15   that when we decided to take the program of      17:14:52

                16   record unconstrained and the program of          17:14:52

                17   record risk adjusted -- 2$ -- off, we agreed     17:14:58

                18   that we would replace it with the program of     17:14:58

                19   record with the technology program and the       17:15:06

                20   extension of the ISS, so that we've              17:15:06

                21   essentially used that to carry the lunar         17:15:06

                22   program.  And there's still the one that we      17:15:15

                23   penciled back in, No. 5, which is basically      17:15:15

                24   the shuttle-derived way of doing that same       17:15:25

                25   program.                                         17:15:25





                                                               223



                 1           So there are actually two programs that  17:15:25

                 2   lead to something like the current lunar         17:15:25

                 3   exploration strategy which differ primarily      17:15:35

                 4   in launch vehicle, and there are three           17:15:35

                 5   variants that are something like the Flexible    17:15:35

                 6   which differ primarily in exploration.           17:15:46

                 7           DR. CHYBA:  And one of those             17:15:46

                 8   categories is 1, right, the program of record    17:15:46

                 9   plus ISS extension?  No.  That was a             17:15:46

                10   commercial crew, wasn't it?                      17:15:55

                11           Okay.  I just want to understand         17:15:55

                12   where we stand.                                  17:15:55

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  That was left -- that      17:15:55

                14   was ambiguous in our discussion, whether in      17:15:55

                15   that putting -- you know, modifying the          17:16:04

                16   program of record to put in the technology       17:16:04

                17   wedge and extend the ISS, we left the Ares I     17:16:12

                18   in -- or we took it out?  The sensitivity        17:16:12

                19   analysis would say that would not be a good      17:16:12

                20   trade.                                           17:16:19

                21           DR. RIDE:  It would say that.  It        17:16:19

                22   would say commercial crew would be a better      17:16:19

                23   trade for that.                                  17:16:19

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  So then maybe if --        17:16:19

                25           DR. RIDE:  So then why don't we          17:16:27

                 1   discuss -- I had kind of missed that we were     17:16:27

                 2   keeping that program of record but with ISS      17:16:27

                 3   extended and technology line in.                 17:16:34

                 4           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah.  I think that was      17:16:34

                 5   just -- I don't know that we had actually        17:16:34

                 6   adopted that.  We were discussing it.            17:16:42

                 7           MR. GREASON:  Yeah.  That was just       17:16:42

                 8   discussion.                                      17:16:42

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  Oh, okay.                  17:16:42

                10           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        17:16:42

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, I was taking         17:16:42

                12   notes on the discussion, so I wrote it down.     17:16:42

                13           MR. GREASON:  If we wished, based on     17:16:53

                14   what we learned, to sort of -- to look at        17:16:53

                15   what would be reasonable with more money for     17:16:53

                16   something looking like the program of record,    17:16:53

                17   I think, based on what we learned, it looks      17:17:01

                18   like 3B with more money.                         17:17:01

                19           DR. RIDE:  Yes.                          17:17:01

                20           MR. McALISTER:  Yeah.                    17:17:01

                21           DR. RIDE:  That's right.                 17:17:15

                22           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, that's right.        17:17:15

                23           DR. RIDE:  That's right.                 17:17:15

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  As you start changing      17:17:15

                25   these, you know, one starts looking like the     17:17:15





                                                               225



                 1   other.                                           17:17:15

                 2           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.                    17:17:15

                 3           MR. McALISTER:  You can see that with    17:17:15

                 4   a bunch of them.                                 17:17:15

                 5           DR. RIDE:  Because, you know --          17:17:15

                 6   you're exactly right.  3B, it does tack on to    17:17:15

                 7   something close to the program of record.        17:17:27

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  Did 3B have the robust     17:17:27

                 9   technology program in it?                        17:17:27

                10           DR. RIDE:  It does.                      17:17:27

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah, it does.  Okay.      17:17:27

                12           DR. RIDE:  It's got the robust           17:17:27

                13   technology.  It's got commercial crew,           17:17:27

                14   because we did that trade and the commercial     17:17:27

                15   crew won out.                                    17:17:39

                16           And we actually looked at the less       17:17:39

                17   constrained version of this, and it did get      17:17:39

                18   you back to human lunar return sometime in       17:17:39

                19   the late 2020s -- I don't remember -- 2028       17:17:54

                20   or --                                            17:17:54

                21           MR. GREASON:  So if we wanted to add     17:17:54

                22   an option that's more POR-like but still         17:17:54

                23   makes sense, a 3B+ might make -- might be        17:17:54

                24   that option.                                     17:18:04

                25           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  And, in fact, it    17:18:04





                                                               226



                 1   ends up having the same parameters as the one    17:18:04

                 2   I jotted down.                                   17:18:04

                 3           MR. GREASON:  Yes.                       17:18:04

                 4           DR. CRAWLEY:  Because they would be      17:18:04

                 5   both based on the program of record, they        17:18:04

                 6   would both include the ISS, they would both      17:18:04

                 7   include the technology program and they would    17:18:12

                 8   both include commercial crew.                    17:18:12

                 9           MR. GREASON:  Right.                     17:18:12

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  So we just arrived at      17:18:12

                11   it from two different angles.                    17:18:21

                12           MR. GREASON:  Okay.                      17:18:21

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  So the easiest thing,      17:18:21

                14   for the purposes of annotation, is just to --    17:18:21

                15   is to add a 3B$ to this sheet, which is the      17:18:21

                16   3B allowed to go to the --                       17:18:28

                17           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.                    17:18:28

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- above guidance          17:18:28

                19   level.                                           17:18:28

                20           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Let's see.  I saw Bo,    17:18:28

                21   and then Leroy and then myself.                  17:18:40

                22           MR. BEJMUK:  Thank you.  Ed, I'm         17:18:40

                23   looking at the scenarios, and the Deep Space,    17:18:40

                24   they only have Mars flyby, right, all of         17:18:47

                25   them?                                            17:18:47





                                                               227



                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  That's what's been         17:18:47

                 2   budgeted into them, that's right.                17:18:53

                 3           MR. BEJMUK:  Okay.                       17:18:53

                 4           DR. CRAWLEY:  Because there's a          17:18:53

                 5   significant technology investment in budget      17:18:53

                 6   to get to the next step.                         17:18:57

                 7           MR. AUGUSTINE:  But they could all       17:18:57

                 8   lead to Mars.                                    17:18:57

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  They lead to Mars,         17:18:57

                10   that's right.                                    17:18:57

                11           MR. BEJMUK:  They lead to Mars.          17:18:57

                12           MR. AUGUSTINE:  They just don't do it    17:18:57

                13   during the period of time we looked at.          17:19:05

                14           MR. BEJMUK:  During the period of        17:19:05

                15   time, okay.                                      17:19:05

                16           So I think we should not recommend       17:19:05

                17   that Americans don't plan to go to Mars.         17:19:13

                18   This would be like, you know -- I feel like      17:19:13

                19   we are capitulating -- I know we are -- money    17:19:22

                20   is big and times are tough.  You know, I know    17:19:22

                21   all of that.  But, you know, things may          17:19:22

                22   change, or they will change -- conditional       17:19:32

                23   probability, right.  There's something that      17:19:32

                24   says if things are really rotten right now,      17:19:32

                25   they won't stay that way; if things are real     17:19:32





                                                               228



                 1   good, they won't stay that way either.           17:19:39

                 2           So I think it's absolutely important     17:19:39

                 3   that this -- in my opinion, that this panel      17:19:39

                 4   does recommend that we -- that Americans go      17:19:45

                 5   to Mars.  And whether it's -- and I, you         17:19:45

                 6   know -- Jeff, you and I very infrequently        17:19:51

                 7   fail to see eye to eye, but in this case, I      17:19:51

                 8   do.                                              17:19:57

                 9           You've got to work on the technology     17:19:57

                10   so we can have a more reasonable way to          17:19:57

                11   getting to Mars, but by God, we ought to plan    17:19:57

                12   to get to Mars, you know.  We would sort of      17:20:07

                13   like fail to -- we would recognize that we       17:20:07

                14   are -- somebody said we would recognize that     17:20:07

                15   we are less than we used to be, you know, and    17:20:07

                16   I don't think that we should do that.            17:20:13

                17           So I think we ought to have to go to     17:20:18

                18   Mars one way or another.                         17:20:18

                19           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Leroy...                 17:20:23

                20           DR. CHIAO:  I just wanted to say,        17:20:23

                21   first of all, I love Mars too.  I love the       17:20:25

                22   Moon.  When I was selected by NASA to be an      17:20:28

                23   astronaut in 1990, it was looking actually       17:20:32

                24   like I might have a shot at going to Mars,       17:20:35

                25   and I certainly thought at a minimum I'd have    17:20:35





                                                               229



                 1   a pretty good shot at going to the Moon.  I      17:20:36

                 2   never dreamed that 19 years later I'd be on      17:20:40

                 3   an Augustine commission.                         17:20:40

                 4           But I agree with -- I want to go to      17:20:47

                 5   Mars, but I agree with Jeff.  If we go to        17:20:51

                 6   Mars, it should be done the right way.           17:20:51

                 7           But I also agree with Bo.  It's not      17:20:56

                 8   something we should give up on.  So I think      17:20:56

                 9   we should carry this because I think it's        17:21:02

                10   important that we do keep that goal.             17:21:02

                11           But I also think it's important to       17:21:02

                12   put the costs down at what we really think it    17:21:09

                13   would be to do it right and present that, if     17:21:09

                14   not as anoption, then as a point of reference    17:21:18

                15   just like the program of record with the         17:21:18

                16   unconstrained budget.  You know, let the         17:21:18

                17   decision makers know what it really would        17:21:18

                18   cost.  So I think it's important to keep --      17:21:27

                19           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Sally, did you want      17:21:27

                20   to make -- I'm sorry.                            17:21:27

                21           DR. CHIAO:  No.  I'm sorry.  I was       17:21:27

                22   just saying I think it's important to keep       17:21:27

                23   that option.                                     17:21:27

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Sally, did you want      17:21:27

                25   to say something?                                17:21:27





                                                               230



                 1           DR. RIDE:  I actually think that's a     17:21:27

                 2   good point, and going -- taking it through       17:21:37

                 3   the budgeting exercise so that we've got a       17:21:37

                 4   cost on what we think is the program, I          17:21:37

                 5   think, would be valuable, knowing that it's      17:21:37

                 6   not, you know, the best costing of a trip to     17:21:51

                 7   Mars, but at least it puts a reference out       17:21:51

                 8   there for us.                                    17:21:51

                 9           What I was going to say was that, you    17:21:51

                10   know, it seems to me that -- you know, I'm       17:21:51

                11   not nearly as deeply involved in the             17:22:05

                12   Deep Space scenario as the Beyond LEO group      17:22:05

                13   has been, you know, but it strikes me that,      17:22:05

                14   you know, that does not take Mars off of the     17:22:13

                15   table.  That doesn't leave out the --            17:22:13

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  That's true.             17:22:13

                17           DR. RIDE:  -- possibility of an          17:22:13

                18   off-ramp to Mars once the technology has         17:22:21

                19   been --                                          17:22:21

                20           DR. CHIAO:  Sure.                        17:22:21

                21           DR. RIDE:  -- developed, and, in         17:22:21

                22   fact, it actually develops -- you know, it's     17:22:21

                23   got the technology line, but it also helps       17:22:29

                24   develop some of the in-space infrastructures     17:22:29

                25   that actually have a shot at making it much      17:22:29





                                                               231



                 1   more reasonable, much more feasible.             17:22:59

                 2           MR. AUGUSTINE:  My turn.                 17:22:59

                 3           MR. GREASON:  Well, I have --

                 4           MR. AUGUSTINE:  My turn.  Okay.

                 5           MR. GREASON:  Do you want to go

                 6   or I'll go?  It's your call.

                 7           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I'll call on Norm.

                 8           Much of what I wanted to say has been    17:22:59

                 9   said, but I'd like -- at the risk of like in     17:22:59

                10   football getting a penalty for piling on, I'd    17:22:59

                11   like to do that.                                 17:22:59

                12           The idea of having a Mars program        17:22:59

                13   that's done properly -- we shouldn't do it if    17:22:59

                14   we can't do it properly, clearly.  So whatever   17:23:14

                15   we define should be, quote, unquote, properly    17:23:14

                16   carried out.                                     17:23:14

                17           So why not show it and let the           17:23:14

                18   numbers speak for themselves, and if the         17:23:14

                19   numbers speak for themselves and they show it    17:23:14

                20   comes in very late, that's fine, so be it.       17:23:28

                21           Sally's point -- and the point I've      17:23:28

                22   been making -- I think we have some              17:23:28

                23   wordsmithing to do to make clear that these      17:23:28

                24   intermediate -- this middle set of options do    17:23:44

                25   include Mars.  They're just not in the time      17:23:44





                                                               232



                 1   frame that we've talked about.  We've tended     17:23:44

                 2   to gloss over that.                              17:23:44

                 3           And then, lastly, there's a              17:23:44

                 4   substantial body of people who would like to     17:23:44

                 5   see their option at least looked at who take     17:23:56

                 6   the point of view that why would you want to     17:23:56

                 7   go back to the Moon, we did that 40 years        17:23:56

                 8   ago, we've been there.                           17:23:56

                 9           There's the point of view of that        17:23:56

                10   group of people that say, you know, why would    17:24:10

                11   you go to L1, are you going to mine fuel at      17:24:10

                12   L1 or what are you going to do at L1, why        17:24:10

                13   would you want to land on an asteroid for a      17:24:10

                14   brief time, kind of like a butterfly landing     17:24:27

                15   on a flower, I mean, what's interesting about    17:24:27

                16   that.                                            17:24:27

                17           The only really interesting thing is     17:24:27

                18   Mars.  So it ought to be an option, and let      17:24:27

                19   the facts fall where they may.  So that would    17:24:27

                20   be my argument.                                  17:24:37

                21           Now, who else did I see.                 17:24:37

                22           Okay.  You're going to rebut that.       17:24:37

                23           MR. GREASON:  No, not really.            17:24:37

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  And I have a comment.      17:24:37

                25           MR. GREASON:  We're in a dilemma         17:24:37





                                                               233



                 1   that's as much driven by our running out of      17:24:37

                 2   time as anything else.  So I'm going to see      17:24:37

                 3   if I can suggest a way out of it.                17:24:46

                 4           The basic problem is it's possible to    17:24:46

                 5   lay out a vision for how -- with the             17:24:51

                 6   insertion of advanced technology and the         17:24:55

                 7   insertion of space infrastructure, how you'd     17:24:55

                 8   get to Mars, and we have a feeling -- and        17:25:00

                 9   that's as far as I'll take it -- that the        17:25:05

                10   beginning steps of that wind up looking not      17:25:12

                11   too dissimilar from what we're calling           17:25:12

                12   Deep Space.  But it is absolutely not within     17:25:18

                13   our capability, as a committee in the time       17:25:23

                14   available, to attempt to produce a cost and a    17:25:23

                15   budget and a schedule for that.                  17:25:27

                16           We could take on, you know, writing a    17:25:27

                17   well-informed piece of science fiction, you      17:25:34

                18   know, saying, you know, this is what the         17:25:39

                19   future might look like and this is why we're     17:25:39

                20   investing in technology and this is how you'd    17:25:45

                21   develop from these kinds of capabilities to a    17:25:50

                22   real Mars mission.  We could probably do         17:25:50

                23   that, but I guarantee we're not going to have    17:25:55

                24   time to do that and then do manifest and then    17:25:55

                25   do budgets and then do schedules.  We just       17:25:58





                                                               234



                 1   can't do it.                                     17:26:04

                 2           Because part of the problem of           17:26:04

                 3   depending on advanced technologies and new       17:26:04

                 4   infrastructure is you aren't completely sure     17:26:11

                 5   what the world is going to look like after       17:26:11

                 6   you have them.                                   17:26:11

                 7           MR. AUGUSTINE:  So -- let's see --       17:26:19

                 8   you're suggesting basically you'd take 10 off    17:26:19

                 9   and deal with it as a discussion item?           17:26:19

                10           MR. GREASON:  I'm not committed          17:26:28

                11   emotionally to whether 10 is on or off.          17:26:28

                12           I feel we're doing a disservice to       17:26:28

                13   our finding that we made as a committee that     17:26:36

                14   we -- that human civilization getting to Mars    17:26:36

                15   is why we do this.  I feel we're doing a huge    17:26:36

                16   disservice to that by holding up, you know,      17:26:45

                17   the current design reference architecture        17:26:45

                18   based on minimal investment of technology and    17:26:54

                19   saying that's how you'd get to Mars, now         17:26:54

                20   we've put a budget number on it, now it's        17:26:54

                21   obviously unaffordable, so we shouldn't do       17:27:01

                22   it.  I don't think that's the posture we're      17:27:01

                23   trying to get in.                                17:27:01

                24           I think the posture we're trying to      17:27:01

                25   get in is we think it's possible to get to       17:27:01





                                                               235



                 1   Mars, we think that we're laying out what the    17:27:14

                 2   first couple of steps on that road are, we       17:27:14

                 3   know we don't know what Steps 4 through 10       17:27:14

                 4   are, although we might have some ideas.          17:27:14

                 5           Maybe instead of laying up this straw    17:27:29

                 6   man just to let the budget office knock it       17:27:29

                 7   over, maybe we would be better served by         17:27:29

                 8   saying qualitatively here's the steps that       17:27:29

                 9   come after.                                      17:27:43

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  Norm, if I can, I tend     17:27:43

                11   to agree with Jeff.  Because I think if you      17:27:43

                12   cost it with the current approach and the        17:27:43

                13   current technology, you would leave an           17:27:56

                14   impression that this was an unattainable         17:27:56

                15   thing, much as it was left in 1991.              17:27:56

                16           And I actually think that what we        17:27:56

                17   should do is we should frame both of the         17:28:05

                18   principal options we have left, which are        17:28:05

                19   basically some version of Deep Space and some    17:28:05

                20   version of Lunar Exploration, with the strong    17:28:05

                21   flavor and the strong recommendation that        17:28:12

                22   they actually be treated as preparatory steps    17:28:12

                23   to going to Mars.                                17:28:19

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  See, that's       17:28:19

                25   been the point I've been after all along --      17:28:19





                                                               236



                 1   is that we don't say that.  They don't even      17:28:19

                 2   have that in a title.                            17:28:31

                 3           MR. GREASON:  Okay.  Well, then          17:28:31

                 4   here's a concrete proposal.  We can't cost       17:28:31

                 5   it, so we can't score it, because it's not a     17:28:31

                 6   different scenario.                              17:28:31

                 7           Let's take the action item to write      17:28:45

                 8   out an exemplary scenario of what the steps      17:28:45

                 9   from here to Mars, given the technology          17:28:45

                10   investment, might look like.                     17:28:45

                11           MR. AUGUSTINE:  And then -- so 10        17:28:45

                12   would not be quantitatively evaluated.  It       17:29:02

                13   would be this carefully written piece.  But I    17:29:02

                14   could live with that --                          17:29:02

                15           MR. GREASON:  It's not an option.        17:29:02

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- only if --            17:29:02

                17           MR. GREASON:  It's a discussion about    17:29:02

                18   how you get from the options above to Mars.      17:29:02

                19           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  I could live      17:29:02

                20   with that only if you make very clear that on    17:29:22

                21   Options 6 and 7 that they aim at Mars -- that    17:29:22

                22   they do aim at Mars, and it's -- the problem     17:29:22

                23   with it now is it sounds like they flyby Mars    17:29:22

                24   and call it a day.                               17:29:22

                25           DR. AUSTIN:  Norm, just one point of     17:29:22





                                                               237



                 1   clarification.  I think the issue I have with    17:29:22

                 2   Option 10 is that we don't think that the        17:29:44

                 3   approach of Mars Direct is the right way to      17:29:44

                 4   be successful in getting to Mars.                17:29:44

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  That's true too.         17:29:44

                 6           DR. AUSTIN:  I think what we -- I        17:29:44

                 7   thought what we were saying was that the         17:29:44

                 8   Deep Space options do lay the first steps to     17:29:44

                 9   how would you smartly plan to go to Mars.        17:29:44

                10           What we failed to do is highlight        17:29:44

                11   that, you know, our expectation is that you      17:29:44

                12   would, in fact, execute those options with a     17:30:20

                13   goal of getting to Mars, but that -- you         17:30:20

                14   know, what you would get in the budget is the    17:30:20

                15   flyby but -- and all of the other steps that     17:30:20

                16   you would take, the technology -- you know,      17:30:20

                17   all of the other planning that you would do      17:30:20

                18   would be with an eye toward getting              17:30:20

                19   yourselves to a point of being able to land      17:30:20

                20   on Mars.                                         17:30:20

                21           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, you know, if we    17:30:20

                22   make clear that Deep Space is a Mars ultimate    17:30:20

                23   option --                                        17:30:20

                24           DR. AUSTIN:  I'm okay with that.         17:30:20

                25           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  I can get with    17:30:20





                                                               238



                 1   that.                                            17:30:20

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  If we had a white board    17:30:20

                 3   here or a flip chart, I'd draw a little          17:30:20

                 4   sketch, so I'll draw it in the air, which is     17:30:20

                 5   really a set of future steps.                    17:30:20

                 6           You know, the first step is either       17:31:03

                 7   something like the Lunar Exploration strategy    17:31:03

                 8   as proposed or something like Deep Space and     17:31:03

                 9   then -- then in some time Deep Space actually    17:31:03

                10   has a branch back to Lunar and, in one or the    17:31:03

                11   other way, they're aimed at going to Mars,       17:31:03

                12   but it's really for the next Augustine           17:31:03

                13   report.                                          17:31:03

                14           You know, it's our responsibility to     17:31:03

                15   do the preparatory work, and there are           17:31:03

                16   basically two opportunities here to lay out      17:31:03

                17   pathways to the preparatory work.                17:31:03

                18           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  I think it        17:31:03

                19   gets to be a nuance that -- I would not be       17:31:03

                20   happy saying here's a program for the next       17:31:03

                21   15 years and, when that's done, we'll get on     17:31:03

                22   with getting to Mars.                            17:31:36

                23           I would be happier with a program        17:31:36

                24   that says we're going to go to Mars and          17:31:36

                25   here's the first 15 years of the way to get      17:31:36





                                                               239



                 1   there.                                           17:31:36

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  I think that's well        17:31:36

                 3   framed.                                          17:31:36

                 4           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Can you see the          17:31:36

                 5   difference?                                      17:31:36

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yes.                       17:31:36

                 7           MR. GREASON:  If you would -- if you     17:31:36

                 8   can accept that anything we say after that is    17:31:36

                 9   going to depend on a lot of assumptions about    17:31:36

                10   how the technologies shake out and that will     17:31:36

                11   tie back into the technology section where it    17:31:36

                12   points out that we have multiple options for     17:31:36

                13   each one of these capabilities, we can tell a    17:31:36

                14   story like that.                                 17:31:36

                15           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  I think we can    17:31:36

                16   too.  Okay.                                      17:31:36

                17           DR. CRAWLEY:  Let me try and             17:31:36

                18   summarize where I think we are.                  17:32:10

                19           That we have two options left on the     17:32:10

                20   table which we will work on to the point         17:32:10

                21   where they fit within the President's budget     17:32:10

                22   guidance, which are 2 and 3B -- the program      17:32:10

                23   of record without the ISS extension, without     17:32:10

                24   the technology wedge, constrained by the '10     17:32:10

                25   budget and the 3B, the ISS Focused, with         17:32:10





                                                               240



                 1   commercial crew, constrained to the '10          17:32:10

                 2   budget.                                          17:32:37

                 3           So those are the two we'll carry         17:32:37

                 4   forward in the anticipation that those will      17:32:37

                 5   be the ones that meet guidance.                  17:32:37

                 6           That we'll retain 1 and 2$ just as a     17:32:37

                 7   reference, that is to say, that's basically      17:32:37

                 8   the unconstrained POR and the constrained        17:32:37

                 9   POR -- the plussed up -- the lightly             17:32:37

                10   constrained POR.                                 17:32:37

                11           Which is a very nice chart, as Sally     17:32:37

                12   used today, to show that if the budget had       17:33:08

                13   been about what the budget was expected to       17:33:08

                14   be, darned all, if five years later, with all    17:33:08

                15   of the sophisticated analysis and the            17:33:08

                16   knowledge we have, it's not far from the         17:33:08

                17   deadlines that they set.  And I think that's     17:33:08

                18   a very important message to send in our          17:33:08

                19   report but as a reference case.                  17:33:08

                20           That we expand -- that we create a 3B    17:33:08

                21   that allows it to go up to the plussed up        17:33:08

                22   budget, which is really the program of record    17:33:45

                23   allowed to drift back up in budget from the      17:33:45

                24   President's current guidance with the            17:33:45

                 2   program.                                         17:33:45

                 3           And that 5 is actually a variant of      17:33:45

                 4   that.  5 is -- that we had to pencil back        17:33:45

                 5   in -- is really just the change-out of the       17:33:45

                 6   launch vehicle on that.                          17:33:45

                 7           MR. GREASON:  Is 5 going to be           17:33:45

                 8   unconstrained, FY '10 constrained or loosely     17:34:16

                 9   constrained?                                     17:34:16

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  Loosely constrained.       17:34:16

                11           DR. RIDE:  Loosely, yeah.                17:34:16

                12           MR. GREASON:  Okay.  So it's kind of     17:34:16

                13   5$?                                              17:34:16

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  It's really 5$, right.     17:34:16

                15   Yeah.  It's the plussed up budget --             17:34:16

                16           MR. GREASON:  Got it.                    17:34:16

                17           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- on 5.                   17:34:16

                18           And the other major variant is the       17:34:16

                19   Deep Space family, which really only varied      17:34:16

                20   by the launch vehicle that's used -- the new     17:34:16

                21   hydrocarbon vehicle, the shuttle-derived         17:34:16

                22   vehicle or the Ares-derived vehicle.             17:34:16

                23           So in some senses, Norm -- and that      17:34:50

                24   we show the -- that we eliminate the             17:34:50

                25   Global Lunar as independent things --            17:34:50





                                                               242



                 1   independent variants and we put the Mars         17:34:50

                 2   discussion into the wrapper, that these are      17:34:50

                 3   ways to get us towards Mars rather than          17:34:50

                 4   explicitly costing the current technology        17:34:50

                 5   design reference mission proposal to get to      17:34:50

                 6   Mars.                                            17:34:50

                 7           So, in essence, you could note that      17:34:50

                 8   we've made sort of sweeping simplification       17:34:50

                 9   that there are only four -- there are only       17:35:18

                10   four options left on the table.  There's the     17:35:18

                11   two that are within guidance, and there's the    17:35:18

                12   two modes of exploration, going to the Moon      17:35:18

                13   or Flexible, and the real variation -- the       17:35:18

                14   variants within those three -- in those          17:35:18

                15   latter two are the launch vehicles switching     17:35:18

                16   in and out, which I think we all understand      17:35:18

                17   are subject to further refinement of the         17:35:18

                18   analysis before we're willing to make a          17:35:18

                19   definitive statement about those.                17:35:18

                20           Did that sound like a reasonable --      17:35:43

                21           MR. BEJMUK:  It's very reasonable as     17:35:43

                22   long as you explain what it means -- Mars        17:35:43

                23   discussion.  You mean identifying it as          17:35:43

                24   destination or just discussion?  I hope you      17:35:43

                25   meant destination.                               17:35:43

                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  Destination, yeah.         17:35:43

                 2           MR. BEJMUK:  Okay.  Because we don't     17:35:43

                 3   want us to be known as --                        17:35:43

                 4           DR. CRAWLEY:  I was just trying to       17:35:43

                 5   capture the spirit of what Jeff proposed.        17:35:43

                 6           MR. BEJMUK:  -- a shrinking vision       17:35:43

                 7   bunch of guys, right.                            17:36:05

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  No.  No shrinking          17:36:05

                 9   vision here, Bo.                                 17:36:05

                10           MR. BEJMUK:  Okay.  Thank you.           17:36:05

                11           MR. GREASON:  Yeah.  I will state it     17:36:05

                12   much more strongly.  I think what we just        17:36:05

                13   took on is the requirement to show               17:36:05

                14   qualitatively how you get from the end state     17:36:05

                15   of these -- of this option to human beings on    17:36:05

                16   Mars.                                            17:36:05

                17           DR. CHYBA:  Or at least one scenario.    17:36:23

                18           MR. GREASON:  Yeah.                      17:36:23

                19           DR. CHYBA:  Because as you said, we      17:36:23

                20   don't actually know how we're going to do        17:36:23

                21   that.                                            17:36:23

                22           MR. GREASON:  Right.  We need to show    17:36:23

                23   that there is at least one way.                  17:36:23

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Existence theorem.       17:36:23

                25           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  So, Norm, we've     17:36:23





                                                               244



                 1   now made considerable progress in the sense      17:36:23

                 2   that we have started with about -- one, two,     17:36:38

                 3   three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,      17:36:38

                 4   ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen -- 14 of           17:36:38

                 5   these -- actually 16 or 17 before we took a      17:36:38

                 6   few off, and we're now down to really about      17:36:38

                 7   four families of options, the two constrained    17:36:54

                 8   ones and the two which we're going to allow      17:36:54

                 9   to the plussed up line, and those two            17:36:54

                10   families really differ primarily in the          17:36:54

                11   launch to LEO vehicle, that we work as a         17:36:54

                12   variant within them.                             17:37:06

                13           So you could actually say we're down     17:37:06

                14   to four options subject to more analysis of      17:37:06

                15   the launch vehicle.                              17:37:06

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Plus our reference       17:37:06

                17   cases.                                           17:37:06

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  Plus the reference         17:37:06

                19   cases.                                           17:37:20

                20           MR. McALISTER:  So we have 2, 3B, 5$     17:37:20

                21   and basically everything that's in yellow,

                22   because they're all versions of Deep Space?

                23           MR. GREASON:  No.

                24           DR. AUSTIN:  Some of them are

                25   unconstrained.

                 1           MR. McALISTER:  Oh, take out the

                 2   unconstrained.

                 3           MR. GREASON:  Let me try and give you

                 4   a complete list.

                 5           MR. McALISTER:  Okay.                    17:37:20

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, how about if we      17:37:20

                 7   go from --                                       17:37:20

                 8           MR. GREASON:  Yes, sir.                  17:37:20

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- my list.                17:37:20

                10           No. 1 has become a reference.            17:37:29

                12   within guidance.                                 17:37:29

                13           No. 2$ has become a reference, the       17:37:29

                14   POR risk adjusted.                               17:37:29

                15           3B is in as one that will be within      17:37:37

                16   guidance.                                        17:37:44

                18   to rise up to the loose guidance, the            17:37:44

                19   plus-up.                                         17:37:51

                20           5 is still in, which is really 5$.       17:37:51

                21   It's the shuttle extension version of that       17:37:55

                22   which will be allowed to rise to the plus-up.    17:38:00

                12           7S Deep Space and the SDV is gone        17:38:29

                13   because it's unconstrained.                      17:38:33

                14           And 7S$ is still in.                     17:38:40

                15           But those are all really the same        17:38:40

                16   option -- all of those in yellow that are        17:38:40

                17   left are the same option with three different    17:38:47

                18   launchers, just as 3B$ and 5B$ are really the    17:38:47

                19   same program with two different launchers.       17:38:54

                20           MR. McALISTER:  And then -- keep         17:38:54

                21   going.                                           17:38:54

                22           DR. CRAWLEY:  And 8 is gone and 9 is     17:38:54

                23   gone because they've collapsed into the other    17:39:00

                24   lunar strategy, 3B$ and 5B$.                     17:39:09

                25           And 10 has become the objective and      17:39:09





                                                               247



                 1   the path on which we seek to place ourselves     17:39:15

                 2   rather than an independent option.               17:39:21

                 3           MR. McALISTER:  Okay.  While everyone    17:39:21

                 4   is assessing that, let me make a couple of       17:39:21

                 5   quick announcements.                             17:39:21

                 6           We have handed out this paper to the     17:39:23

                 7   members of the public to facilitate the          17:39:26

                 8   discussion, but I want to just caveat that by    17:39:32

                 9   saying this was a snapshot in time done by a     17:39:32

                10   subset of the committee.                         17:39:37

                11           So this is not in any way a final        17:39:37

                12   output.  So when people take this printout       17:39:37

                13   out from the meeting, this is not the way we     17:39:43

                14   ended up.                                        17:39:43

                15           Secondly, we're holding the press        17:39:49

                16   event until after we're done, which hopefully    17:39:49

                17   will be in about 30 minutes or so.               17:39:49

                18           And the presentations that we gave

                19   today -- Ed's first one, Sally's and

                20   Wanda's -- as well as this chart are on the

                21   website -- not this chart yet -- the other

                22   three are all on the website currently as of

                23   now.                                             14:27:15

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  If this chart goes on    14:27:15

                25   a website, it needs to be caveated --            14:27:29





                                                               248



                 1           MR. McALISTER:  Right.                   14:27:53

                 2           MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- pretty strongly.      14:27:54

                 3           MR. McALISTER:  Yeah.  We haven't put    14:28:04

                 4   that up yet.  I was going to wait for that.      14:28:18

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  Be sure that      14:28:25

                 6   gets caveated, or we'll mislead the world.       14:28:28

                 7           MR. McALISTER:  Right.                   14:28:41

                 8           MR. GREASON:  Do we still need to now    14:28:47

                 9   go back and have the scoring discussion on       14:28:52

                10   those that -- those which survived?              14:29:00

                11           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  That's the        14:29:08

                12   thing to do.                                     14:31:11

                13           MR. GREASON:  Okay.                      14:31:13

                14           MR. AUGUSTINE:  And -- let's see.  I     14:31:14

                15   just want to double-check here.  7S$, the        14:31:28

                16   last of the yellow ones --                       15:17:03

                17           MR. McALISTER:  7S$?                     15:17:55

                18           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  That will --      15:17:59

                19   with a plus-up budget has a reasonable shot      15:18:34

                20   of being a viable program, if I'm not            15:18:42

                21   mistaken.  Am I reading that right?              15:19:04

                22           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         15:19:10

                23           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  Okay.             15:19:14

                24           MR. GREASON:  All three of them, we      15:20:17

                25   think, have a reasonable shot or we wouldn't     15:20:22





                                                               249



                 1   leave them on the list.                          15:20:34

                 2           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.                    15:20:43

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  At the plus-up     15:20:53

                 4   level where the plus-up has some funds on it     15:20:59

                 5   still.  And, you know, they're not going to      15:21:48

                 6   come in at exactly the same price, but...        15:22:01

                 7           MR. AUGUSTINE:  So those will be our     15:22:19

                 8   options, and the evaluation, to some extent,     15:22:21

                 9   will be adjusted based on new facts.             15:22:45

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yes.                       15:22:53

                11           MR. AUGUSTINE:  But if -- okay.          15:22:55

                12   That's the end of that.                          15:23:02

                13           Why don't we go ahead and discuss --     15:23:07

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, okay.                15:23:07

                15           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I would suggest you      15:23:16

                16   do it by column just for the ones --             15:23:17

                17           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     15:24:10

                18           MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- as Jeff says, that    15:24:12

                19   are still on.                                    15:24:20

                20           DR. CRAWLEY:  And, Mr. Chairman, you     15:24:24

                21   have to give us some guidance here as to --      15:24:30

                22   are we ordering in dinner or --                  15:24:57

                23           MR. AUGUSTINE:  We're going strong.      15:25:08

                24   Let's try that.                                  15:25:16

                25           DR. CRAWLEY:  We're going strong,        15:25:19





                                                               250



                 1   okay.                                            15:25:24

                 2           MR. AUGUSTINE:  For one thing, if you    15:25:37

                 3   made the ground rule that there are no           15:25:42

                 4   more -- you can't argue unless there's a         15:25:49

                 5   difference of two, there are none of these       15:25:55

                 6   that there are a difference of two.              15:26:11

                 7           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, it's between your    15:26:20

                 8   opinion and what these are.                      15:26:24

                 9           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Oh, I see.               15:26:32

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  So just to -- now you      15:26:40

                11   have to consult back to Wanda's charts, which    15:26:44

                12   are also in front of you.                        15:27:01

                13           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Right.                   15:27:08

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  So, you know, what         15:27:11

                15   constitutes a zero, one, two, minus one and      15:27:31

                16   minus two for -- let's start with Exploration    15:27:42

                17   Preparation, which happens to be Chart 4 in      15:27:53

                18   Wanda's charts.                                  15:28:03

                19           And I have in front of me a              15:28:37

                20   reference, the OSTP statement of task            15:28:47

                21   guidance, which also helps clarify this.         15:28:57

                22           So, for example, this one is             15:29:04

                23   clarified in the OSTP guidance as overall        15:29:11

                24   architecture capability, mission duration,       15:29:20

                25   mass delivered to LEO and other selected         15:29:37





                                                               251



                 1   destinations, flexibility, et cetera.            15:29:47

                 2           So the scale was set up with the         15:30:15

                 3   intent that line 1 would usually be a zero,      15:30:20

                 4   which it is in this case, and then the           15:30:29

                 5   general tendency is that things that are in      15:30:37

                 6   more highly constrained budgets lose numbers     15:30:48

                 7   and things that have -- I've got to be           15:30:59

                 8   careful -- things that have less launch          15:31:07

                 9   capability lose numbers.  That's the general     15:31:15

                10   trend in this column.                            15:31:23

                11           MR. GREASON:  That doesn't seem to       15:31:30

                12   match Wanda's chart, because some of this is     15:31:34

                13   also kind of about its ability to grow.  It's    15:31:38

                14   not just about how much you throw but --         15:31:50

                15           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        15:32:00

                16           MR. GREASON:  -- where it's going        15:32:03

                17   from there.                                      15:32:17

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  So tell me what     15:32:22

                19   you differ by -- you disagree with by more       15:32:31

                20   than one.                                        15:33:04

                21           MR. GREASON:  Okay.  I think that all    15:33:06

                22   of the yellow scenarios -- yellow dollar sign    15:33:11

                23   scenarios are a one, and you've got one of       15:33:32

                24   them scored as low as a minus one.  And I        15:33:40

                25   think they all provide exploration beyond LEO    15:33:55

                 1   with the ability to grow and evolve.             15:34:02

                 2           DR. RIDE:  I actually had those          15:34:13

                 3   circled also because --                          15:34:15

                 4           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.                      15:35:15

                 5           DR. RIDE:  -- I don't quite              15:35:17

                 6   understand.                                      15:35:24

                 7           MR. AUGUSTINE:  They should be --        15:36:04

                 8   particularly with the discussion we just had,    15:36:07

                 9   they should be plus ones instead of minus        15:36:12

                10   ones, both of those.                             15:36:21

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, there's a            15:36:29

                12   question -- before we put them all at plus       15:36:36

                13   one, there are substantial performance           15:36:41

                14   differences amongst these vehicles.              15:36:47

                15           So if you scored the ability to grow     15:36:54

                16   and expand robustly in the future, you would,    15:36:58

                17   I think, have to take into consideration the     15:37:12

                18   fact that some vehicles are more capable than    15:37:20

                19   other vehicles.                                  15:37:29

                20           DR. RIDE:  I'd argue that --             15:37:51

                21           MR. GREASON:  But capable is one of      15:37:57

                22   those fuzzy words.                               15:38:15

                23           Because, you know, in the long haul,     15:38:26

                24   which is what growth is all about, it's          15:38:31

                25   ultimately about dollars per kilogram, and,      15:38:41





                                                               253



                 1   you know, however much budget the nation has     15:38:53

                 2   got, we can throw that many kilograms.  And      15:38:58

                 3   while I agree there may be differences           15:39:14

                 4   between these two in cost -- at least in cost    15:39:19

                 5   effectiveness, it's not at all obvious that,     15:39:35

                 6   you know, bigger/fewer is better.                15:39:46

                 7           And I don't think we're smart enough     15:40:01

                 8   yet to distinguish those shades of gray.  So     15:40:04

                 9   I would just score them all as a one.            15:40:17

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, that would be        15:40:23

                11   consistent with your position.                   15:40:25

                12           MR. GREASON:  It would.                  15:41:14

                13           DR. RIDE:  But let me add something      15:41:17

                14   to that too.                                     15:41:20

                15           You know, the Exploration                15:41:24

                16   Preparation, it's not just about the launch      15:42:18

                17   vehicle, and the Deep Space, in particular --    15:42:21

                18   you know, these both -- you know, they           15:42:35

                19   envision in-space architecture, they envision    15:43:01

                20   the improved technology development.             15:43:10

                21           You know, so if we're looking beyond     15:43:20

                22   just the launch vehicle, then I -- you know,     15:43:25

                23   I'd argue that those should be plus one.         15:43:29

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, and that, Sally,     15:43:38

                25   was why the one that I was using as the key,     15:43:44





                                                               254



                 1   which is 6, compared to 1 is actually            15:43:53

                 2   incremented up one.  With the same launch        15:44:14

                 3   vehicle and the same budget, I scored the        15:44:21

                 4   Deep Space options as more capable or            15:44:31

                 5   providing more exploration capability, right.    15:44:50

                 6           But then when you cut the budget --      15:45:01

                 7           MR. GREASON:  I just don't see budget    15:45:11

                 8   on the Exploration Preparation scoring           15:45:14

                 9   matrix.                                          15:45:20

                10           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        15:45:23

                11           DR. AUSTIN:  I would also suggest,       15:46:31

                12   Ed, that if we eliminated something from the     15:46:43

                13   stack that we ought to set the evaluation        15:47:09

                14   criteria for the range of options that we've     15:47:18

                15   got.                                             15:47:26

                16           You know, giving something a lot of      15:47:29

                17   credit that we've already taken off of the       15:47:33

                18   list doesn't help us to differentiate between    15:47:47

                19   the ones that are left.                          15:47:54

                20           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, now we're            15:48:06

                21   redefining the list and the evaluation           15:48:10

                22   criteria.                                        15:48:17

                23           MR. GREASON:  Well, even if we don't     15:48:35

                24   go that far, I just -- you know, I'm just        15:48:41

                25   reading the chart, and I don't see the           15:48:47





                                                               255



                 1   parameters that you're down-scoring these on     15:49:11

                 2   there.                                           15:49:58

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, one of the           15:50:10

                 4   White House criteria is mass delivered to low    15:50:14

                 5   Earth orbit.  And, in addition, as you           15:50:30

                 6   understand, these vehicles also have             15:50:34

                 7   considerably different fairing sizes --          15:50:41

                 8           MR. GREASON:  Yes.                       15:50:54

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- so that at least in     15:50:57

                10   the budgeted case for the hydrocarbon booster    15:52:38

                11   it's 6.8 meters compared -- which is already     15:52:53

                12   a hammerhead fairing compared to 10 meters       15:53:03

                13   without a hammerhead and potentially             15:53:32

                14   12 meters with a hammerhead.  I quoted an        15:53:40

                15   exterior dimension in one case and an            15:54:40

                16   interior dimension in another.  Forgive me.      15:54:46

                17   But the consistent numbers would be 7.2 and      15:54:54

                18   10 or 12, right.                                 15:55:02

                19           So, you know, if you want to put big     15:55:11

                20   things into space, having a bigger vehicle       15:55:15

                21   allows you to put bigger things into space.      15:55:22

                22   I mean, that was my rationale for --             15:55:28

                23           DR. RIDE:  It's going down.              15:55:43

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  You're absolutely          15:55:54

                25   right, Sally, that it's not just the launch      15:56:23





                                                               256



                 1   vehicle but the launch vehicle's first stage.    15:56:29

                 2           But if we were to go back by this        15:56:44

                 3   same criteria and score the line that's          15:56:51

                 4   missing, which is 3B$, which is the, you         15:57:01

                 5   know, exploration of the lunar surface, would    15:57:21

                 6   you call that a zero or a one?                   15:57:41

                 7           DR. RIDE:  Well, let me just point       15:57:52

                 8   out that now that we've -- I think this is       15:57:55

                 9   perhaps Wanda's point.                           15:58:04

                10           Now that we've eliminated some of        15:58:08

                11   these scenarios, particularly the                15:58:12

                12   unconstrained budget ones, we have none of       15:58:15

                13   our supposed scenarios which actually score      15:58:22

                14   above zero in Exploration Preparation.  So       15:58:37

                15   they're not growing our ability to explore,      15:58:45

                16   and that just -- I mean, it just doesn't         15:59:15

                17   sound right on the face of it.                   15:59:19

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  And I --            15:59:28

                19           MR. BEJMUK:  In fact, I was just         15:59:28

                20   looking at this Deep Space dual Ares Lite        15:59:59

                21   with plus-up budget, zero.  And I read           16:01:10

                22   what -- No. 2 in Exploration Preparation:        16:01:24

                23   Develops operational robustness to explore       16:01:39

                24   destination beyond LEO.                          16:01:51

                25           That's the most robust vehicle we        16:02:00

                 1   have in our list.  That's the one that gets      16:02:10

                 2   you to the Moon, about -- I don't know -- 15,    16:02:16

                 3   20 metric tons on each of the two launches.      16:02:29

                 4   That's the one that may allow you to convert     16:02:40

                 5   Altair to hypergolic.  That's the one that       16:02:57

                 6   flies a high-q at 700 psf.                       16:03:41

                 7           I mean, that's the -- that, to me, is    16:09:14

                 8   robustness -- operational robustness.  And I     16:09:30

                 9   would expect -- I'd argue to have it two         16:09:54

                10   instead of zero for that case.                   16:10:01

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  And which case was         16:10:51

                12   that?  I'm sorry, Bo.                            16:10:55

                15           MR. BEJMUK:  Where you have zero --      16:18:43

                16   you see, I can't pick on you, Ed, because        16:18:46

                17   you're starting to get -- unless I have a        16:31:52

                20   been picking on me, for one, so --               16:33:53

                21           MR. BEJMUK:  -- that I do disagree by    16:34:42

                22   two points, and I think that one should          16:35:14

                23   have -- 6$ should have two.  It's the most       16:36:14

                24   robust case that we have on this list.           16:36:25

                25           MR. GREASON:  And I differ from Bo       16:36:33

                 1   but only by one.                                 16:36:40

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  See, there you are.        16:36:57

                 3           DR. RIDE:  And I think the other two     16:37:00

                 4   in the yellow that are left should be plus       16:37:07

                 5   one.  You know, I'm happy --                     16:37:14

                 6           MR. AUGUSTINE:  And I agree with         16:37:19

                 7   that.                                            16:37:21

                 8           DR. RIDE:  I'm happy to go with the      16:37:21

                 9   two on the first one, but the other two          16:37:25

                10   should definitely be plus one.                   16:37:41

                11           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah, I agree with that.     16:37:51

                12           MR. GREASON:  I have no objection.       16:37:59

                13           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Those are with ones      16:38:06

                14   that look like you're not doing anything.        16:38:09

                15           DR. CRAWLEY:  Now, we have to be         16:38:15

                16   careful because we also have to do the two       16:38:18

                17   that have to be penciled in here, which are      16:38:23

                18   3B --                                            16:38:31

                19           MR. GREASON:  Dollar and 5$.             16:38:36

                20           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- yeah -- 3B$ and 5$,     16:38:49

                21   right.                                           16:39:05

                22           MR. GREASON:  I don't see the how the    16:39:09

                23   Exploration Preparation of 5$ is meaningfully    16:39:16

                24   different from the Exploration Preparation of    16:40:44

                25   7S$.                                             16:40:55

                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  Unless you think that      16:41:16

                 2   the destinations and activities in one mode      16:41:18

                 3   would be significantly different than the        16:41:30

                 4   explorations and activities in the other.        16:41:48

                 5           MR. GREASON:  Okay.  I hate to do        16:41:55

                 6   this, but since we're on this point, I have      16:41:57

                 7   to.                                              16:42:03

                 8           We're penalizing the Lunar Surface       16:42:06

                 9   because it's derived from the program of         16:42:25

                10   record and the program of record had no plans    16:42:30

                11   to make use of the Lunar Surface in a way        16:45:24

                12   that robustly supported Exploration              16:45:31

                13   Preparation.                                     16:45:41

                14           It's not like the Lunar Surface is a     16:45:54

                15   bad place to do it.  It's just that we didn't    16:46:01

                16   choose to take our time to go off and            16:46:07

                17   redesign how a different, more                   16:46:11

                18   exploration-forward Lunar Surface set of         16:46:18

                19   systems would look.                              16:46:25

                20           DR. CRAWLEY:  I asked a question.  I     16:46:30

                21   didn't --                                        16:46:33

                22           MR. GREASON:  Well, so the problem       16:46:34

                23   is -- which way you answer that question --      16:46:39

                24   it's hard to score because are you scoring it    16:46:45

                25   exactly the way it is now or are you scoring     16:46:53





                                                               260



                 1   it the way that you could do it if you really    16:46:59

                 2   valued this metric.                              16:47:21

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  I think you'd score        16:47:37

                 4   it -- since we've sort of redefined this to      16:47:44

                 5   be the more Mars-forward version of the Moon,    16:47:50

                 6   then you'd score it that way.                    16:48:00

                 7           MR. GREASON:  Then I would not           16:48:02

                 8   distinguish between them on the grounds of       16:48:08

                 9   destination --                                   16:48:21

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     16:48:30

                11           MR. GREASON:  -- in my opinion.          16:48:33

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  I would agree with         16:49:36

                13   that.                                            16:49:39

                14           MR. GREASON:  But we have to write       16:49:42

                15   some words around that.                          16:49:45

                16           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  Right.  So we       16:49:50

                17   would score 3B$ as a two and 5$ as a one,        16:49:59

                18   which is consistent with --                      16:50:14

                19           MR. GREASON:  Yes.                       16:50:18

                20           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- what I have below.      16:50:20

                21           Norm?                                    16:50:26

                22           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Sure.                    16:50:28

                23           DR. CRAWLEY:  A point here for           16:50:30

                24   reference.  Should we also score the two -- I    16:50:36

                25   suppose we should -- that are the constrained    16:50:47

                 1   cases?                                           16:50:53

                 2           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.                    16:50:56

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right?                     16:50:58

                 4           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  I think so.       16:51:02

                 5           DR. CRAWLEY:  Because we have to show    16:51:05

                 6   the White House that --                          16:51:21

                 7           MR. AUGUSTINE:  There are cases.         16:51:26

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- there are cases.        16:51:28

                 9           MR. GREASON:  Yes.  And I agree with     16:52:03

                10   your current scoring in those scenarios.         16:52:07

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.                      16:52:15

                12           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  I do too.         16:52:17

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay?                      16:52:20

                14           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         16:52:24

                15           DR. CRAWLEY:  So now we've got half      16:52:26

                16   of the first column done.                        16:52:31

                17           MR. GREASON:  We have the whole first    16:53:40

                18   column done actually.                            16:53:43

                19           DR. RIDE:  I think we have the whole     16:54:05

                20   first column.  I think we're done.               16:54:13

                21           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, no, because we       16:54:18

                22   haven't scored the two that are -- the           16:54:20

                23   constrained ones.  We have to now score 2 and    16:54:27

                24   3B.                                              16:54:36

                 1   just thought I was saying, I agreed with your    16:54:44

                 2   scoring.                                         16:54:57

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  Oh, you agreed with the    16:54:58

                 4   scoring?                                         16:55:20

                 5           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         16:55:21

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.                      16:55:25

                 7           DR. RIDE:  We're done.                   16:55:27

                10   consolation, this is the only column I have      16:56:23

                11   all of these notes on.                           16:56:38

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.                      16:56:44

                13           MR. McALISTER:  Good.                    16:56:50

                14           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think maybe some       16:56:56

                15   explanation is required for people who are       16:56:58

                16   wondering why we're taking your time to do       16:57:20

                17   this.                                            16:57:26

                18           We're required by law to publicly        16:57:30

                19   have this debate, and we couldn't sit down       16:57:37

                20   ahead of time and kind of in a -- figure out     16:57:45

                21   what we thought was right and come here and      16:57:53

                22   agree upon it.  So that's the reason for this    16:58:01

                23   agonizing procedure.                             16:58:13

                24           And I'm prepared to stay here until      16:58:18

                 6   don't understand.  I think it's impossible to    17:00:35

                 7   work with, but that's the law.                   17:00:37

                 8           And so we will stay for as long as we    17:00:42

                 9   have to.                                         17:01:12

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  This is sunshine and       17:01:13

                11   government at work.                              17:01:21

                12           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Column 2...              17:01:24

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  So now we're --     17:01:25

                14   the dominant factor in the evaluation that       17:01:39

                15   went into this was whether these programs had    17:01:45

                16   either elements that had significant             17:01:51

                17   technology associated with them -- in the        17:01:54

                18   case of the hydrocarbon engine, that accounts    17:01:58

                19   for the slight plus-up -- or whether they        17:02:06

                20   were associated with scenarios where there       17:02:21

                21   was the budget wedge.                            17:02:28

                22           Now, if we put the budget wedge in       17:02:31

                23   all of them that we're carrying forward --       17:02:35

                24   ah, we're not carrying it in the two             17:02:58

                25   baselines.                                       17:03:03

                 1           MR. GREASON:  Correct.                   17:03:59

                 2           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        17:04:01

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  So --              17:04:02

                 4           MR. GREASON:  I believe you have         17:04:33

                 5   scored this correctly for all of those           17:04:36

                 6   factors.                                         17:04:41

                 7           DR. AUSTIN:  Or within one.              17:04:54

                 8           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         17:05:00

                 9           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah.  That looks good to    17:05:04

                10   me.                                              17:05:09

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  We have to put in 3B$,     17:05:12

                12   which would be, I think, a one.                  17:05:49

                13           MR. GREASON:  That would be a one.       17:05:54

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  And 5B$ would also be a    17:06:17

                15   one.                                             17:06:25

                16           DR. RIDE:  Also be a one.                17:06:26

                17           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Right.                   17:07:22

                18           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         17:07:34

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  And 3B would clearly       17:07:38

                20   not -- did 3B have the technology wedge in       17:07:44

                21   it?                                              17:07:51

                22           MR. GREASON:  It did.                    17:07:56

                23           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         17:07:59

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  Oh, it did?  So it         17:08:00

                25   would be a one.                                  17:08:10

                 1           MR. GREASON:  Yes.                       17:08:12

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  And --                     17:08:15

                 5           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, and -- no.  We       17:08:35

                 6   need to do 2.                                    17:08:46

                 7           MR. GREASON:  2 is correctly scored      17:08:51

                 8   at a minus two.                                  17:08:54

                 9           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         17:08:58

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  3B had the technology      17:09:28

                11   wedge in it.                                     17:09:32

                12           DR. RIDE:  Yes.                          17:09:48

                13           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.                    17:09:52

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  And 2 did not.             17:09:54

                15           DR. CHIAO:  Right.                       17:10:00

                16           MR. McALISTER:  Ed, we're going to       17:10:08

                17   use your sheet as the master.  So please make    17:10:12

                18   sure you're capturing these comments, because    17:10:17

                19   I lost -- I lost lock on this about              17:10:24

                20   20 minutes ago.                                  17:10:34

                21           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  Well, in the        17:10:35

                23           MR. McALISTER:  A wrap-up maybe.         17:10:51

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  We'll do read-back         17:10:58

                 1           So the way I have this scored -- and     17:11:23

                 2   forgive me -- because the order might be a       17:11:28

                 3   little different based on where you wrote        17:11:35

                 4   things in.  I have 2 as a minus two, 3B as a     17:11:41

                 5   one, 3B$ as a one, 5$ as a one, 6$ as a one,     17:12:05

                 6   7$ as a two and 7S$ as a one.                    17:12:25

                 7           DR. RIDE:  Yep.                          17:12:38

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  Read-back correct?         17:12:40

                 9           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Wait a minute.  Do       17:12:43

                10   you have a one or a minus one?                   17:12:52

                11           MR. GREASON:  We were just reading       17:13:45

                12   the --                                           17:13:47

                13           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Excuse me.  I'm          17:13:48

                14   sorry.  I read the wrong column.  You've got     17:13:49

                15   it right.  Wrong column.                         17:14:00

                16           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  Now, my good        17:14:10

                17   colleague Professor Chyba has left, and he       17:14:15

                18   was the domain expert for the                    17:14:43

                19   Science Knowledge column.                        17:15:35

                20           And it was very -- it was fairly         17:16:05

                21   simple reasoning, which is that if we thought    17:16:09

                22   there was a good chance to get -- if he          17:16:28

                23   thought there was a good chance in the           17:16:48

                24   scenario to get to either the Moon or a NEO,     17:16:54

                25   it got a one, and if there was a good chance     17:17:29





                                                               267



                 1   to get to the Moon and a NEO, it got a two,      17:17:36

                 2   because those, he argued, were the principal     17:17:45

                 3   differentiating science objectives.              17:17:51

                 4           MR. AUGUSTINE:  So he had four he        17:17:59

                 5   rated a two, and we took them all out.           17:18:04

                 6           MR. McALISTER:  That's right.            17:19:31

                 7   They're all gone.  I just took them out.         17:19:33

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  So right now, if you       17:20:53

                 9   read down Science, in Option 2, my               17:20:56

                10   recollection -- we would want to go back and     17:21:24

                11   check this -- actually if we could agree to      17:21:31

                12   that scoring, we could just -- we could just     17:21:37

                13   take that as the rule and apply it, because,     17:21:47

                14   otherwise, we would be remembering from          17:21:55

                15   memory through Sally's charts what --            17:21:59

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  Why don't we      17:22:07

                17   do that.                                         17:22:10

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- what was and wasn't.    17:22:12

                19           DR. AUSTIN:  We just need to do a 3B$    17:23:53

                20   and 5B.                                          17:24:26

                21           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.                    17:24:31

                22           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  But, you           17:24:49

                23   know -- and the Mars one is no longer            17:24:54

                24   relevant.  So the idea being, if you achieve     17:25:29

                25   one significant science planetary or             17:25:38





                                                               268



                 1   subplanetary encounter, it's a one, and if       17:26:39

                 2   you encounter two of them, it's a two.           17:26:46

                 3           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  So 3B gets        17:27:13

                 4   a --                                             17:27:20

                 5           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, what we have to      17:27:21

                 6   do is we have to go back and look at the         17:27:26

                 7   charts to see --                                 17:27:35

                 8           DR. RIDE:  That's right.                 17:27:38

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- what actually           17:27:44

                10   happens.                                         17:27:52

                11           DR. RIDE:  That's right.  And I think    17:27:53

                12   those charts are, you know, one iteration        17:27:58

                13   away from being able to look at that.            17:28:15

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     17:28:34

                15           DR. RIDE:  But we can fill in this.      17:28:36

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  But that's just going    17:28:42

                17   to be --                                         17:28:43

                18           DR. RIDE:  Because we agree on that,     17:28:44

                19   then --                                          17:29:19

                20           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     17:29:24

                21           DR. RIDE:  -- we can fill this in.       17:29:27

                22           MR. AUGUSTINE:  That would just be a     17:30:15

                23   fact that falls out.                             17:30:34

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  That's right.              17:30:42

                25           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         17:30:43

                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  It's just a decision       17:30:44

                 2   rule that will apply.                            17:30:48

                 3           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.                    17:30:53

                 4           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  Human               17:30:56

                 5   Civilization -- Leroy...                         17:31:02

                 6           (Discussion off the record.)             17:32:20

                 7           DR. CRAWLEY:  And actually if you        17:32:20

                 8   take off the corrections for more budget and     17:32:29

                 9   less budget, which -- the way we argued this     17:32:34

                10   was that --                                      17:32:45

                11           MR. GREASON:  Well, this subtract two    17:33:23

                12   for constraints -- okay.                         17:33:28

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, that's just my       17:33:30

                14   notes at the bottom.  Okay.                      17:33:32

                15           If you didn't get past the ISS, for      17:36:21

                16   all practical purposes, you got a minus one.     17:36:27

                17           So the case -- the ISS -- Case 3B,       17:36:48

                18   which is the ISS Focused, gets a -- makes,       17:37:00

                19   arguably compared to Wanda's references, less    17:37:24

                20   than a zero's worth of progress --               17:37:35

                21           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Right.                   17:37:46

                22           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- towards human           17:37:49

                23   civilization away from the Earth, and            17:37:52

                24   essentially you're still around the Earth.       17:37:58

                25   And the other ones that are associated with      17:39:08

                 1   going to the Moon, which would be now 3$ and     17:39:13

                 2   3B$, would get a one because it addresses        17:39:20

                 3   crew-oriented effects to enable sustained        17:39:27

                 4   human presence off of the planet.                17:39:36

                 5           MR. GREASON:  And I don't understand     17:39:48

                 6   why the yellow scenarios don't do the same       17:39:51

                 7   thing.                                           17:39:57

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  So one could argue they    17:40:04

                 9   do, or one could argue that, as the ultimate     17:40:07

                10   objective is civilization on a surface, they     17:40:20

                11   should be penalized for not going to a           17:40:31

                12   surface immediately.                             17:40:41

                13           Or also in this evaluation criteria      17:41:08

                14   is the idea about protection of the              17:41:18

                15   civilization on this planet, and you could       17:41:23

                16   argue that going to NEOs should give them the    17:41:29

                17   credit back.                                     17:41:36

                18           That's sort of the reasoning here.       17:42:06

                19           MR. GREASON:  I would opine that,        17:42:09

                20   first, extraterrestrial resources brought        17:42:13

                21   from lunar space are interesting as a future     17:48:56

                22   exploration enabler and both the Moon and        17:49:06

                23   NEOs are in play there.                          17:49:35

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     17:49:49

                25           MR. GREASON:  Second, that in terms      17:49:50





                                                               271



                 1   of studying the crew effects, i.e., how do       17:50:09

                 2   you keep people alive away from the Earth        17:50:20

                 3   long enough to get to Mars, both the Moon and    17:50:30

                 4   long NEO missions shed equal light on that.      17:51:01

                 5           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     17:51:29

                 6           MR. GREASON:  Yeah.  The Moon is a       18:01:55

                 7   bigger body, but the NEOs are also               18:01:58

                 8   interesting for reasons of civilization          18:01:58

                 9   protection here.  So I think it's kind of a      18:02:01

                10   wash.                                            18:02:01

                11           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         18:02:01

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.                      18:02:03

                13           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  I can buy         18:02:03

                14   that.                                            18:02:08

                15           DR. RIDE:  I think so too.               18:02:08

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  So they're all ones?     18:02:08

                17           DR. RIDE:  They're ones.                 18:02:11

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  So they're all ones        18:02:11

                19   except the two constrained ones.  Let's go       18:02:11

                20   back and check those.                            18:02:11

                21           The 3B, which is you don't get off of    18:02:15

                22   the space station, is a minus one.               18:02:15

                23           And the program of record adjusted       18:02:23

                24   for risk constrained to FY '10, boy, it          18:02:23

                25   doesn't really do anything more than going to    18:02:34





                                                               272



                 1   the space station either, does it?               18:02:34

                 2           DR. RIDE:  No, it doesn't.               18:02:34

                 3           MR. GREASON:  And it doesn't even        18:02:34

                 4   keep the space station up long enough to         18:02:34

                 5   get -- buy you out of the space station.  So     18:02:34

                 6   that's --                                        18:02:34

                 7           DR. RIDE:  That's right.                 18:02:34

                 8           MR. GREASON:  -- why it scored a         18:02:51

                 9   minus two.                                       18:02:51

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  Maybe minus two is         18:02:51

                11   right.                                           18:02:51

                12           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         18:02:51

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  So let me do the    18:02:51

                14   read-back on this one, which is Scenario 2 is    18:02:51

                15   minus two, Scenario 3B is minus one, 3B$ is      18:02:51

                16   one, 5$ is one, 6$, 7$ and 8S$ are all one.      18:03:09

                17           MR. GREASON:  7S$, yes.                  18:03:09

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  7S$.  I'm sorry.           18:03:09

                19   Right?                                           18:03:09

                20           DR. RIDE:  Yep.                          18:03:09

                21           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  So on to            18:03:24

                22   Economic Expansion.                              18:03:24

                23           Now, Economic Expansion includes         18:03:24

                24   things like stimulation of the burgeoning        18:03:24

                25   commercial space industry and sustaining the     18:03:29





                                                               273



                 1   established industrial base in technology and    18:03:33

                 2   aerospace.                                       18:03:37

                 3           So, for example, a minus one is a        18:03:40

                 4   weakens industrial base, limited opportunity     18:03:43

                 5   for commercial goods and services.  And a        18:03:46

                 6   plus one is stimulates investment in new and     18:03:48

                 7   existing capabilities.                           18:03:51

                 8           DR. RIDE:  So why aren't all of the      18:03:55

                 9   ones that stimulate Commercial Crew to LEO       18:03:55

                10   plus one?                                        18:04:03

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, because some of      18:04:03

                12   them stimulate more things than others.          18:04:03

                13   Right?                                           18:04:03

                14           DR. RIDE:  But shouldn't they all be     18:04:03

                15   at least plus one as opposed to zero?  Since     18:04:03

                16   Commercial Crew to LEO --                        18:04:08

                17           DR. CRAWLEY:  That's probably right.     18:04:13

                18           MR. GREASON:  If and only if, I would    18:04:13

                19   argue, the market that we're making for them     18:04:17

                20   is sustained --                                  18:04:17

                21           DR. RIDE:  Leads to a larger market.     18:04:17

                22           MR. GREASON:  -- enough that anybody     18:04:17

                23   would actually invest in it.                     18:04:23

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  But it is          18:04:23

                25   certainly the intent to stimulate them with      18:04:31

                 1   the Commercial Crew and --                       18:04:31

                 2           MR. GREASON:  As long as we actually     18:04:31

                 3   buy commercial crew missions for long enough     18:04:31

                 4   to make an industry, yes, I agree with you.      18:04:31

                 5           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         18:04:38

                 6           MR. AUGUSTINE:  But these options        18:04:38

                 7   would do that.                                   18:04:38

                 8           MR. GREASON:  Well, some of the          18:04:38

                 9   reference options don't but --                   18:04:38

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  And that I believe         18:04:43

                11   Commercial Crew is in all of these, right.       18:04:43

                12           And then the question is -- and this     18:04:43

                13   is sort of a double-edged sword -- if you        18:04:49

                14   believe that along with the hydrocarbon          18:04:49

                15   booster goes a different business model which    18:04:54

                16   will end up producing less money flowing to      18:04:56

                17   the commercial community because it saves        18:04:58

                18   money -- right -- you can't take credit for      18:05:01

                19   stimulating more business by spending less       18:05:04

                20   money -- does that deserve any higher ranking    18:05:06

                21   or not.                                          18:05:10

                22           MR. GREASON:  Yes, you can stimulate     18:05:12

                23   new business by doing less money easily as       18:05:16

                24   long as you spend your less money in a way       18:05:16

                25   that's competitive.                              18:05:17





                                                               275



                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  Fair to say.  And is       18:05:21

                 2   there much competition for a heavy               18:05:21

                 3   hydrocarbon booster?                             18:05:25

                 4           MR. GREASON:  That's not obvious.        18:05:27

                 5   But the heavy hydrocarbon booster goes with      18:05:29

                 6   propellant transfer that most likely would be    18:05:33

                 7   an additional stimulus to the commercial         18:05:38

                 8   market by virtue of its smaller size.            18:05:42

                 9           Furthermore, all of the yellow           18:05:46

                10   options, let us not forget, currently include    18:05:48

                11   a commercially sourced lander --                 18:05:49

                12           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        18:05:49

                13           MR. GREASON:  -- to match with the       18:05:51

                14   government ascent stage.  So I really do         18:05:53

                15   think there's a significant qualitative          18:05:54

                16   difference between those and the other           18:05:55

                17   options.                                         18:05:57

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.                      18:05:58

                19           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         18:05:58

                20           DR. CRAWLEY:  So do you want to go to    18:05:59

                21   a two on those?                                  18:06:01

                22           MR. GREASON:  I want them to be one      18:06:04

                23   more than the other one.  I've lost track of     18:06:04

                24   exactly what that is.                            18:06:11

                25           MR. McALISTER:  That's within the        18:06:13





                                                               276



                 1   precision, right?                                18:06:13

                 2           MR. GREASON:  Well, I'm not sure.        18:06:13

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  One more than the other    18:06:13

                 4   one meaning --                                   18:06:13

                 5           MR. GREASON:  One more than the          18:06:16

                 6   blue-derived options.                            18:06:16

                 7           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- than the                18:06:17

                 8   blue-derived options.                            18:06:17

                 9           DR. RIDE:  And those look like           18:06:17

                10   zeroes.                                          18:06:20

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  Zero.  Okay.               18:06:20

                12           MR. GREASON:  As long as they're         18:06:20

                13   distinguishable, I'm okay.                       18:06:23

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.                      18:06:25

                15           DR. RIDE:  Although they're zeroes,      18:06:25

                16   they do have Commercial Crew.                    18:06:29

                17           DR. CRAWLEY:  They do have Commercial    18:06:31

                18   Crew, so maybe we should make them ones and      18:06:30

                19   twos.                                            18:06:32

                20           DR. RIDE:  I'm happy to make them --     18:06:34

                21   I think the difference between the blue and      18:06:34

                22   the yellow is what's --                          18:06:36

                23           DR. CHIAO:  It's more important.         18:06:36

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yes.                       18:06:36

                25           DR. RIDE:  -- the important one here.    18:06:40





                                                               277



                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.                      18:06:40

                 2           MR. GREASON:  I don't care if you        18:06:40

                 3   call them zero and one --                        18:06:40

                 4           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, because we also      18:06:43

                 5   have to make the difference to the baseline.     18:06:43

                 6   So let's call the blues one and the yellows      18:06:46

                 7   two.                                             18:06:52

                 8           MR. GREASON:  Fine.                      18:06:52

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  And then two is            18:06:52

                10   actually what Wanda's criteria are.  Two is      18:06:54

                11   commercial systems form an integral part of      18:06:58

                12   the architecture --                              18:07:01

                13           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Right.                   18:07:01

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- which is accurately     18:07:02

                15   reflected there.                                 18:07:02

                16           Okay.  So now let's go back and          18:07:04

                17   check --                                         18:07:08

                18           MR. BEJMUK:  You know, I've got -- I     18:07:08

                19   have a problem with this.  We are making too     18:07:08

                20   many positives out of this propellant            18:07:13

                21   transfer.                                        18:07:16

                22           You know, it's a complexity.  It's an    18:07:16

                23   expense.  It's a bad thing.  You wish you        18:07:18

                24   didn't have to do it.  And somehow we are --     18:07:20

                25   you know, the second time I'm hearing that       18:07:22





                                                               278



                 1   that's a positive thing, we are to give it       18:07:24

                 2   credit.                                          18:07:28

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  Because we gave it         18:07:28

                 4   credit in technology as well.                    18:07:30

                 5           MR. BEJMUK:  Well, okay.                 18:07:30

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  Actually we didn't give    18:07:32

                 7   the propellant transfer --                       18:07:34

                 8           MR. BEJMUK:  It's not a robustness       18:07:36

                 9   case.                                            18:07:38

                10           It's just the opposite.  It's a          18:07:38

                11   fragile situation when you have to count on      18:07:40

                12   stopping in space someplace and do the           18:07:43

                13   rendezvous and God knows what and not crash      18:07:45

                14   and not blow up and not leak and -- you know,    18:07:48

                15   and transfer propellant.                         18:07:56

                16           So I can't, you know, accept that        18:07:56

                17   this is -- in Technology Innovation, yes, but    18:08:03

                18   we somehow have to find a negative of it.        18:08:03

                19           DR. RIDE:  Well, we've got several       18:08:07

                20   other columns here that would -- and probably    18:08:07

                21   a few of those would speak to that.  I don't     18:08:13

                22   think this is the column, though, to score       18:08:13

                23   that potential problem.                          18:08:19

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Safety and Success       18:08:19

                25   might pick that up.                              18:08:19





                                                               279



                 1           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah, Safety and Success     18:08:19

                 2   might.                                           18:08:24

                 3           MR. BEJMUK:  Okay.  Maybe Safety.        18:08:24

                 4   Okay.  I can live with that.                     18:08:28

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.                    18:08:30

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  It actually         18:08:30

                 7   goes -- it's a good point, Bo, because --        18:08:30

                 8           MR. GREASON:  Actually let me note in    18:08:33

                 9   passing, though, that the way we just scored     18:08:34

                10   it we didn't actually invoke that --             18:08:36

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  No.                        18:08:36

                12           MR. GREASON:  -- to give a higher        18:08:40

                13   score to that option.                            18:08:40

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  No, we didn't.  We         18:08:42

                15   invoked one increment for commercial crew and    18:08:44

                16   the second one for commercial in -- in           18:08:51

                17   lander.                                          18:08:51

                18           MR. GREASON:  Yes.                       18:08:51

                19           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         18:08:51

                20           DR. CRAWLEY:  All right.  So we're       18:08:54

                21   still on Economic Expansion -- but we do want    18:08:54

                22   to respect Bo's point -- is that when we go      18:08:56

                23   and look at the schedule risk -- the Schedule    18:08:59

                24   and Programmatic Risk, as the category is        18:09:01

                25   called in full, it's not just simply a matter    18:09:04





                                                               280



                 1   of reading numbers off of the Aerospace          18:09:08

                 2   charts, but there has to be some additional      18:09:13

                 3   technology associated or programmatically        18:09:16

                 4   associated uncertainty or risk with those.       18:09:18

                 5           Now, you know, maybe the Aerospace       18:09:21

                 6   analysis with their correlation of cost and      18:09:23

                 7   schedule risk has already put that in but --     18:09:27

                 8           MR. GREASON:  Well, maybe not.           18:09:29

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  But maybe not.             18:09:29

                10           MR. GREASON:  I happen to agree with     18:09:30

                11   Bo's point, that the risk and technology are,    18:09:32

                12   to a certain extent, duals of each other.        18:09:34

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     18:09:34

                14           MR. GREASON:  And the problem is, if     18:09:40

                15   you always only minimize the risk, you never     18:09:40

                16   get to the point where you wish to take the      18:09:44

                17   risk concerning the technology, which is --      18:09:49

                18   we have ample experience operating the           18:09:49

                19   program that way now, and we know what that      18:09:55

                20   looks like.                                      18:09:55

                21           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  So we're still      18:09:55

                22   on Economic Expansion, and we're going up to     18:09:55

                23   3B, which is ISS Focused.  And I think since     18:10:01

                24   that has Commercial Crew in it the consistent    18:10:06

                25   rating of that would be a one, right?            18:10:11





                                                               281



                 1           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think that's right.    18:10:13

                 2           MR. GREASON:  Well, hang on.  I lost     18:10:15

                 3   track again.  The yellow options, did we call    18:10:16

                 4   those ones or twos?  Because they're --          18:10:22

                 5           DR. CRAWLEY:  We called them twos.       18:10:24

                 6           MR. GREASON:  Okay.  Then that's a       18:10:25

                 7   one.                                             18:10:26

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  And then the --            18:10:28

                 9           MR. GREASON:  5$, ditto.                 18:10:32

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  No.  No.  The one we       18:10:34

                11   haven't done is No. 2, which is the              18:10:37

                12   constrained but -- and help me, Sally, 2 does    18:10:40

                13   not extend the station?                          18:10:49

                14           MR. GREASON:  Correct.                   18:10:53

                15           DR. RIDE:  Correct.                      18:10:53

                16           DR. CRAWLEY:  So you would call it at    18:10:55

                17   least a zero.  It has COTS cargo, but you        18:11:00

                18   would never -- you'd never get a commercial      18:11:05

                19   crew market going on a station that was going    18:11:05

                20   to be ended.                                     18:11:05

                21           MR. AUGUSTINE:  If you did, it would     18:11:05

                22   only be brief --                                 18:11:05

                23           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        18:11:12

                24           MR. GREASON:  And commercial cargo       18:11:12

                25   would be just coming online about the time       18:11:12





                                                               282



                 1   that the station went away.                      18:11:12

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  So I would         18:11:12

                 3   suggest we score that as zero.                   18:11:17

                 4           MR. GREASON:  Or lower.                  18:11:17

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.                    18:11:17

                 6           DR. RIDE:  Or lower.                     18:11:17

                 7           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think it's a minus     18:11:17

                 8   one.                                             18:11:23

                 9           Read your definition.  Zero is it        18:11:23

                10   sustains the industrial base and has limited     18:11:23

                11   opportunity --

                12           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.

                13           MR. GREASON:  And it says limited

                14   opportunity for commercial goods and

                15   services.

                16           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.                      18:11:27

                17           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        18:11:27

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.                      18:11:27

                19           DR. RIDE:  And 2 does not have the       18:11:27

                20   technology budget line in it either.             18:11:27

                21           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  So let me read      18:11:32

                22   this back.  The 2 is a minus one, that 3B is     18:11:32

                23   a one, the 3B$ is a one, the 5$ is a one and     18:11:40

                24   the yellow ones are all twos.  Right?  Okay.     18:11:50

                25           DR. AUSTIN:  This is Economic            18:11:59

                 1   Expansion you just did?                          18:12:02

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah, Economic             18:12:02

                 3   Expansion.                                       18:12:03

                 4           MR. BEJMUK:  Would you keep reminding    18:12:03

                 5   us of the columns, because we get lost?          18:12:03

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  I'm sorry.  That was       18:12:06

                 7   all on Economic Expansion.                       18:12:07

                 8           MR. BEJMUK:  Thank you.                  18:12:09

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  Now, the Public            18:12:10

                10   Engagement one is frankly very subjective.       18:12:13

                11           DR. RIDE:  And those aren't?             18:12:19

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, because -- thank     18:12:22

                13   you for that.  That's why we went through all    18:12:24

                14   of the work of doing this fine piece of work     18:12:27

                15   on the rubrics, right.                           18:12:29

                16           Because -- but even by reading the       18:12:33

                17   rubrics, one realizes that the main              18:12:33

                18   distinguisher here is how much it interests      18:12:37

                19   the public and how much it allows engagement     18:12:41

                20   and how much it excites the youth --             18:12:47

                21           DR. AUSTIN:  And education.              18:12:47

                22           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- and education.          18:12:47

                23           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, then let me        18:12:47

                24   propose a measure that has two criteria.         18:12:52

                25           Criteria one is that it has us going     18:12:52





                                                               284



                 1   someplace or doing something really              18:12:58

                 2   interesting and, secondly, that you don't        18:13:02

                 3   have to wait 20 years to do the first event.     18:13:02

                 4   You have events along the way.                   18:13:02

                 5           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     18:13:02

                 6           MR. AUGUSTINE:  And if we use that,      18:13:05

                 7   it falls out, I think, pretty easily.            18:13:05

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  So what I --       18:13:10

                 9   that was my rationale, Norm --                   18:13:10

                10           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.                    18:13:11

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- is that the ones        18:13:11

                12   were because this -- the Flexible Path takes     18:13:14

                13   us to places that we have not been and is        18:13:18

                14   designed to have a cadence of flights there.     18:13:21

                15           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Right.                   18:13:29

                16           DR. CRAWLEY:  Whereas the lunar ones     18:13:30

                17   suffer from the problem that -- when you         18:13:32

                18   explain to many of your neighbors that we're     18:13:34

                19   going to the Moon, they say haven't we done      18:13:37

                20   that.                                            18:13:39

                21           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.                    18:13:39

                22           DR. CRAWLEY:  And the ISS one was,       18:13:39

                23   even by Leroy's agreement, one notch down        18:13:43

                24   from that.                                       18:13:47

                25           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think that's true.     18:13:50

                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  When Leroy tells people    18:13:55

                 2   he went to the ISS, they say where's that.       18:13:59

                 3           So if there is general agreement on      18:14:02

                 4   that, then I'll say -- then let me do the        18:14:05

                 5   read-through -- is that 2 is a zero, 3B is a     18:14:08

                 6   minus one -- we're doing Public Engagement.      18:14:11

                 7           DR. AUSTIN:  All right.  3B is a         18:14:17

                 8   minus one?                                       18:14:11

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  I actually         18:14:20

                10   don't think we changed any of these.             18:14:20

                11           MR. GREASON:  No.                        18:14:20

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  The shuttle extension,     18:14:25

                13   which goes eventually -- I'm sorry.              18:14:25

                14           DR. AUSTIN:  It's a minus.               18:14:28

                15           DR. CRAWLEY:  3B$ --                     18:14:31

                16           DR. RIDE:  Hold a second.  Did you       18:14:34

                17   say 2 was a zero?                                18:14:36

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  I said 2 was a zero.       18:14:39

                19           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Right.                   18:14:39

                20           DR. CRAWLEY:  Or is that not true?       18:14:43

                21           DR. RIDE:  Well, I don't --              18:14:43

                22           DR. CRAWLEY:  Does it get to the         18:14:43

                23   Moon?                                            18:14:48

                24           DR. RIDE:  I don't see how it can be     18:14:48

                25   rated higher than 3B.                            18:14:48

                 1           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah, I agree.               18:14:52

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  Because --                 18:14:52

                 3           DR. CHIAO:  I agree.                     18:14:52

                 4           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  You know, with 2       18:14:52

                 5   you lose the station.  Although de-orbiting      18:14:52

                 6   the station would engage the public.             18:14:58

                 7           DR. CHIAO:  There would be a surge in    18:14:58

                 8   interest, yeah.                                  18:15:05

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  Who was it who told us     18:15:05

                10   the story they sent the command to de-orbit      18:15:05

                11   Skylab?                                          18:15:05

                12           DR. CHIAO:  That was Hawes.              18:15:05

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  It was Hawes, yeah.        18:15:05

                14           DR. RIDE:  It was Hawes, yeah.           18:15:05

                15           DR. CRAWLEY:  Are you famous for         18:15:13

                16   that, Mike?  Oh, he's not here.                  18:15:13

                17           MR. AUGUSTINE:  He landed in the         18:15:13

                18   middle of Australia too.                         18:15:19

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  I would agree with         18:15:19

                20   you --                                           18:15:19

                21           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  So what are       18:15:19

                22   you going to give --                             18:15:25

                23           DR. CRAWLEY:  So we're going to give     18:15:25

                24   2 a minus one at your recommendation and --      18:15:25

                25   2 a minus one and 3B a minus one and 3B$ --      18:15:33





                                                               287



                 1           DR. CHIAO:  The same.                    18:15:45

                 2           MR. BEJMUK:  Hey, Ed, in fairness --     18:15:45

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  No.  Because 3B$           18:15:45

                 4   actually gets to the Moon.                       18:15:50

                 5           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         18:15:50

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.                      18:15:50

                 7           MR. BEJMUK:  Ed, something doesn't       18:15:50

                 8   seem fair.  On this Public Engagement, I         18:15:57

                 9   don't understand why POR is lower -- rated       18:15:57

                10   lower than, let's say, dual Ares.                18:15:57

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, let me try to        18:16:05

                12   explain, Bo.                                     18:16:05

                13           MR. BEJMUK:  Yeah.                       18:16:05

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  Line 2 is -- which is      18:16:05

                15   POR constrained to the budget, doesn't           18:16:11

                16   actually get --                                  18:16:11

                17           MR. BEJMUK:  I'm talking                 18:16:16

                18   unconstrained budget.                            18:16:16

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  No.  2 is POR              18:16:16

                20   constrained to the budget.                       18:16:19

                21           MR. BEJMUK:  But my question was on      18:16:19

                22   number -- line No. 1 --                          18:16:23

                23           DR. CRAWLEY:  Oh, we're not ranking      18:16:23

                24   them by line number.                             18:16:23

                25           MR. BEJMUK:  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.        18:16:23





                                                               288



                 1   All right.                                       18:16:27

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  Because we're      18:16:27

                 3   not going to -- that's being shown for           18:16:31

                 4   reference but...                                 18:16:31

                 5           MR. BEJMUK:  Okay.                       18:16:34

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  So line 2 -- Option 2      18:16:34

                 7   is minus one because it doesn't actually get     18:16:39

                 8   to the Moon.  Line 3B is minus one.              18:16:43

                 9   Line 3B$, which we think does get to the         18:16:47

                10   Moon, gets a zero.  The shuttle extension,       18:16:53

                11   which we think does get to the Moon, gets a      18:16:57

                12   zero.  And the yellows get a one.                18:17:01

                13           DR. AUSTIN:  What was 5B?  I'm sorry.    18:17:09

                14           MR. McALISTER:  I'm sorry.               18:17:09

                15           DR. AUSTIN:  What was 5$?                18:17:12

                16           DR. CRAWLEY:  5$ was a zero.  It gets    18:17:12

                17   to the Moon.                                     18:17:17

                18           Okay.  Now, Leroy's input on the         18:17:19

                19   Global Partners one was interesting, which       18:17:28

                20   essentially summarized the situation as          18:17:31

                21   follows -- that right now what the global        18:17:35

                22   partners care about is extending the ISS and     18:17:37

                23   the things that terminate the ISS will           18:17:42

                24   cause --                                         18:17:46

                25           DR. RIDE:  A reaction.                   18:17:46





                                                               289



                 1           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think those should     18:17:46

                 2   be minus twos.                                   18:17:53

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- will cause -- I'm       18:17:53

                 4   trying to find the word --                       18:17:53

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  There will be a huge     18:17:53

                 6   setback in --                                    18:17:53

                 7           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- disrupt existing        18:17:53

                 8   international partnerships.                      18:17:59

                 9           DR. RIDE:  So I'd go with a minus        18:17:59

                10   two.                                             18:18:07

                11           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah.  I wouldn't --         18:18:07

                12           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  Why don't we      18:18:07

                13   do that.                                         18:18:07

                14           DR. CHIAO:  I'd go with a minus two.     18:18:07

                15           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think those are        18:18:07

                16   minus twos, and I think all of the yellow        18:18:07

                17   ones we just ought to put TBD, because we        18:18:17

                18   don't --                                         18:18:17

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, what we did is we    18:18:17

                20   assigned a zero to anything other than the       18:18:17

                21   ones that turned off the space station.          18:18:17

                22           DR. CHIAO:  We assigned a zero to        18:18:29

                23   anything that kept the space station.            18:18:29

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  I'm sorry.  We kept a      18:18:29

                25   zero -- we assigned a zero to anything that      18:18:29





                                                               290



                 1   kept the space station.                          18:18:29

                 2           DR. CHIAO:  Because there's not a        18:18:29

                 3   definition to differentiate between the          18:18:29

                 4   different scenarios.                             18:18:41

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think that's okay.     18:18:41

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  And we argued that, you    18:18:41

                 7   know, in view of the fact that it requires       18:18:41

                 8   commitment by the IPs to be involved in          18:18:41

                 9   these, we would commit the sin of trying to      18:18:41

                10   project onto the international partners what     18:18:54

                11   we thought their intent was and, therefore,      18:18:54

                12   was best left as just penalize the ones that     18:18:54

                13   shut off the ISS and leave the others at         18:18:54

                14   zero.                                            18:18:54

                15           DR. AUSTIN:  I agree.  I think, you      18:19:08

                16   know, in the report we can certainly reflect     18:19:08

                17   that our view is that we think it is good to     18:19:08

                18   engage the engagement but not --                 18:19:08

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  Sure.                      18:19:08

                20           DR. AUSTIN:  -- to take credit for       18:19:08

                21   it.                                              18:19:08

                22           DR. CRAWLEY:  But presumably in Les'     18:19:08

                23   section that there will be a discussion of       18:19:08

                24   that.                                            18:19:08

                25           DR. AUSTIN:  I agree.                    18:19:08

                 1           MR. GREASON:  Right.  Exactly.           18:19:08

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  So it's the difference     18:19:22

                 3   between an evaluation criteria and an            18:19:22

                 4   additional finding.                              18:19:22

                 5           DR. RIDE:  You know, it may be worth     18:19:22

                 6   noting that all of the Flexible Path             18:19:22

                 7   scenarios probably leave quite a bit more        18:19:22

                 8   room for international partnership --            18:19:22

                 9           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah.                        18:19:22

                10           DR. RIDE:  -- than the other             18:19:33

                11   scenarios.                                       18:19:33

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  I'm not sure I agree       18:19:33

                13   with that.                                       18:19:33

                14           You know, the internationals actually    18:19:33

                15   have, in the course of the discussion that       18:19:33

                16   NASA has had with them in the last year,         18:19:46

                17   warmed to the idea of supplying components,      18:19:46

                18   doing parallel logistics streams to the          18:19:46

                19   surface.                                         18:19:46

                20           You know, you would have to imagine      18:19:46

                21   that -- we have pictures of American             18:19:55

                22   astronauts on the Moon, and no other nation      18:19:55

                23   does.  So the appeal of having their national    18:19:55

                24   astronauts stand with their flag on the Moon     18:20:06

                25   would be quite compelling.                       18:20:06





                                                               292



                 1           So I'm not sure that I would find a      18:20:06

                 2   basis for differentiating the two in terms of    18:20:14

                 3   international participation.                     18:20:14

                 4           DR. RIDE:  You know, I suppose it        18:20:14

                 5   depends on how much of the architecture you      18:20:27

                 6   think is relatively well determined already.     18:20:27

                 7   Because one of the things that we heard          18:20:27

                 8   pretty loud and clear is that they'd like to     18:20:27

                 9   be, you know, more directly involved in, you     18:20:27

                10   know, the process of getting there --            18:20:40

                11           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah, the critical path.     18:20:40

                12           DR. RIDE:  -- the critical path --       18:20:40

                13   and think that they have some systems to         18:20:40

                14   contribute.                                      18:20:40

                15           You know, I don't want to -- I'm not     18:20:40

                16   making a big case for this one, but I -- you     18:20:40

                17   know, I've come away with the impression that    18:20:50

                18   there's -- there are more opportunities in       18:20:50

                19   the Flexible Path scenario from the              18:20:50

                20   international partners.                          18:21:01

                21           DR. CHIAO:  Well, I agree, but I         18:21:01

                22   think it's hard to determine, which is why we    18:21:01

                23   kind of left it zero.                            18:21:01

                24           DR. RIDE:  Yeah, I agree with that.      18:21:01

                25           DR. CHIAO:  But, I mean, it's hard       18:21:01





                                                               293



                 1   to -- I don't know.                              18:21:01

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  I would tend to leave      18:21:01

                 3   it at Leroy's suggestion here.                   18:21:16

                 4           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  I'm fine with that.    18:21:16

                 5           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  So we have          18:21:16

                 6   line 2 -- now we're under Global Partners.       18:21:16

                 7   Line 2 is minus two because it's the one left    18:21:16

                 8   that closes the ISS, and the rest are all        18:21:16

                 9   zeroes.                                          18:21:31

                10           MR. AUGUSTINE:  All right.               18:21:31

                11           DR. RIDE:  Okay.                         18:21:31

                12           DR. AUSTIN:  Agreed.                     18:21:31

                13           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Sustainability.          18:21:31

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  Now, Sustainability is     18:21:31

                15   a rather complex one, and even within the        18:21:31

                16   definitions, there's a lot of -- well,           18:21:44

                17   actually the rubrics are sort of symptomatic     18:21:44

                18   as opposed to descriptive.                       18:21:44

                19           You know, you would have to              18:21:44

                20   understand that something was going well or      18:21:57

                21   something was going poorly in order to           18:21:57

                22   understand how much advocacy you would           18:21:57

                23   require or would be -- would flow.  So let me    18:21:57

                24   read you the guidance from the statement of      18:22:06

                25   task from OSTP that's under here.                18:22:06

                 1           Norm, this is where the input that --    18:22:15

                 2   this is where we book-keep the input that's      18:22:15

                 3   been given to you by OSTP about contractual      18:22:15

                 4   implications.                                    18:22:15

                 5           The potential to enhance                 18:22:15

                 6   sustainability of human space flight             18:22:24

                 7   activities -- which is a completely generic      18:22:24

                 8   statement -- the implications for transition     18:22:29

                 9   from the current human space flight              18:22:29

                10   operations -- in other words, this is where      18:22:35

                11   the transition risk and agony would be           18:22:35

                12   reflected -- and the benefit to U.S.             18:22:41

                13   government defense and intelligence              18:22:41

                14   space-related capabilities.                      18:22:46

                15           So this is where the other government    18:22:46

                16   agency benefits are also book-kept.  So this     18:22:52

                17   is actually sort of a rich category when you     18:22:52

                18   analyze it this way.                             18:22:57

                19           So I think what we did in the --         18:23:02

                20           DR. AUSTIN:  On the other hand, Ed,      18:23:02

                21   if you also recognize there's a fiscal risk      18:23:05

                22   here that applies across the board --            18:23:08

                23           MR. McALISTER:  That there's what --     18:23:10

                24   I'm sorry -- Wanda?                              18:23:11

                25           DR. AUSTIN:  Fiscal risk in the fact     18:23:11

                 1   of just trying to maintain the funding, as       18:23:14

                 2   we've seen with --                               18:23:17

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  But I would        18:23:17

                 4   argue that's an effect and not a cause.  I       18:23:18

                 5   mean, you have trouble maintaining the budget    18:23:21

                 6   because of these other factors.                  18:23:24

                 7           DR. AUSTIN:  I guess it's about          18:23:29

                 8   commitment and will -- you know, do we have a    18:23:32

                 9   national will to do this.                        18:23:32

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  Uh-huh.  So what you       18:23:36

                11   see here is basically -- let's see.              18:23:39

                12           Jeff, you did this, and I don't          18:23:44

                13   remember how much of it you changed.             18:23:46

                14           But what got graded down here is the     18:23:48

                15   case where there's significant disruption in     18:23:52

                16   the NASA organization in order to go to the      18:23:55

                17   new change of business -- the new way of         18:23:59

                18   doing business, which is associated with the     18:24:01

                19   hydrocarbon booster, and, you know, we don't     18:24:03

                20   disagree that that's the case.                   18:24:06

                21           You take it as a financial benefit       18:24:09

                22   and you take -- you penalize the risk.  And,     18:24:09

                23   in fact, I scored at a minus one the Ares V      18:24:14

                24   dual Lite because, of course, there is no        18:24:23

                25   Ares V contract but there is an Ares I           18:24:26

                 1   contract.  So the cancellation of the Ares I     18:24:32

                 2   would cause disruption.                          18:24:39

                 3           Although there's a good deal of          18:24:39

                 4   commonality, there would be contractual          18:24:39

                 5   either renegotiation or recompetition that       18:24:39

                 6   would be associated with -- there.               18:24:48

                 7           And I didn't actually know how to        18:24:48

                 8   think through the shuttle-derived vehicle.  I    18:24:48

                 9   suspect that would be, likewise, a fair          18:24:48

                10   amount of -- I mean, you wouldn't                18:24:59

                11   automatically give to Boeing the contract        18:24:59

                12   for --                                           18:24:59

                13           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, it depends.        18:24:59

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- the shuttle-derived     18:24:59

                15   vehicle --                                       18:24:59

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  You know, you could      18:24:59

                17   also argue that --                               18:25:15

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- just because they       18:25:15

                19   built the shuttle.                               18:24:59

                20           MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- if you did            18:24:59

                21   shuttle-derived vehicle and in that case you     18:25:15

                22   said you ought to continue the shuttle,          18:25:15

                23   that's the least disruptive.                     18:25:15

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, that's why we        18:25:15

                25   scored it as zero, whereas --                    18:25:15

                 1           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I thought you said --    18:25:15

                 2   let's see.                                       18:25:15

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  We're in                   18:25:15

                 4   Sustainability.  You see the SDV ones --         18:25:15

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  Okay.             18:25:15

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- are a zero.  The        18:25:31

                 7   Ares V, because it terminates the Ares I --      18:25:31

                 8           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Right.                   18:25:31

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- was a minus one, and    18:25:31

                10   the hydrocarbon booster was a minus two          18:25:31

                11   because it's not only a change in contract       18:25:31

                12   but a change in organizational behavior of       18:25:31

                13   NASA and workforce and so forth.                 18:25:55

                14           MR. GREASON:  I think the                18:25:55

                15   continuation of the shuttle goes to the          18:25:55

                16   scenario not listed here, the 5$.                18:25:55

                17           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  That's right.      18:25:55

                18           MR. GREASON:  Because I think he's       18:25:55

                19   saying that might actually be more popular       18:25:55

                20   because it's -- you know, all of those people    18:25:55

                21   who current -- not only does everybody keep      18:25:55

                22   doing what they're doing, but all of those       18:25:55

                23   people who are afraid they were going to stop    18:25:55

                24   doing what they're doing get told they --        18:26:16

                25           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     18:26:16





                                                               298



                 1           MR. GREASON:  -- get to keep doing       18:26:16

                 2   it.                                              18:26:16

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  So, you know, we could     18:26:16

                 4   move them to plus one, zero and minus one.       18:26:16

                 5           But, you know, I was reading the         18:26:16

                 6   rubrics, and zero is sufficient public and       18:26:16

                 7   congressional support.  You know, one is plus    18:26:16

                 8   broad support from industry and external         18:26:16

                 9   agencies, i.e., the DOD.                         18:26:16

                10           MR. GREASON:  It's more popular but      18:26:33

                11   not with more stakeholders.                      18:26:33

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     18:26:33

                13           MR. GREASON:  Okay.                      18:26:33

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  I mean, in order to get    18:26:33

                15   to a two here -- well --                         18:26:33

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think we need to be    18:26:33

                17   careful that we don't redefine Sustainability    18:26:33

                18   to just mean non-disruptiveness.  It's more      18:26:33

                19   than that.                                       18:26:52

                20           MR. GREASON:  I was going to raise       18:26:52

                21   the point that, while I absolutely agree that    18:26:52

                22   a change in the way of doing business is         18:26:52

                23   radical as we've contemplated under Option 7     18:26:52

                24   is a huge disruption, I also think that, you     18:26:52

                25   know, at the end of the day, DOD is getting a    18:27:07





                                                               299



                 1   much better booster in their stable, and I'm     18:27:07

                 2   not at all sure that that's not a partially      18:27:07

                 3   offsetting factor under this metric, the way     18:27:07

                 4   you have it defined.                             18:27:25

                 5           DR. CHIAO:  Does DOD want this           18:27:25

                 6   booster though?                                  18:27:25

                 7           MR. GREASON:  As long as they don't      18:27:25

                 8   have to pay for it and as long as they get --    18:27:25

                 9   as long as they get to manage the program        18:27:25

                10   with other people's money, those are good        18:27:25

                11   things.                                          18:27:25

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  There's a complex          18:27:25

                13   statement.                                       18:27:36

                14           MR. GREASON:  There is.  I'm asking      18:27:36

                15   the question.  I'm not taking the position.      18:27:36

                16           DR. CRAWLEY:  Also, Norm, in this        18:27:36

                17   category it would be the pattern of interim      18:27:36

                18   accomplishments which would probably tend to     18:27:36

                19   cause the yellow ones to drift up a bit.         18:27:48

                20           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Right.                   18:27:48

                21           DR. CRAWLEY:  You know, that every       18:27:48

                22   year you can tell the Congress and every two     18:27:48

                23   years you can tell the President that you did    18:27:48

                24   something, you know.                             18:28:00

                25           So if we wanted to cause all of the      18:28:00

                 1   yellow ones to drift up as a group because of    18:28:00

                 2   that pattern --                                  18:28:00

                 3           MR. GREASON:  I'm good with that.        18:28:13

                 4           MR. AUGUSTINE:  You know, we've got      18:28:13

                 5   to be very careful in defining this because a    18:28:13

                 6   big factor in Sustainability is going to be      18:28:13

                 7   the cost -- the magnitude of it, but we've       18:28:13

                 8   really stripped that out.                        18:28:13

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, that's right.        18:28:13

                10   The cost is reflected in the cost category,      18:28:13

                11   and the schedule is in the schedule category.    18:28:23

                12   This is, you know, for fixed costs and           18:28:23

                13   schedule, how easily are you going to find       18:28:23

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  So how about             18:28:34

                17   rereading where we think we are.                 18:28:34

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, I think there        18:28:34

                19   was -- everyone just sort of nodded if we        18:28:44

                20   said we took the yellow ones and bumped them     18:28:44

                21   up one so that --                                18:28:44

                22           DR. AUSTIN:  7S is minus one.            18:28:44

                23           DR. CRAWLEY:  And -- let's see -- did    18:28:44

                24   we --                                            18:28:44

                25           DR. AUSTIN:  6$ is zero.                 18:28:55

                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  So let me try -- I'm       18:29:01

                 2   not sure we've actually gone through the         18:29:02

                 3   whole list.                                      18:29:04

                 4           The 2, the program of record adjusted    18:29:05

                 5   to budget, I would think would be about a        18:29:07

                 6   minus one on this scale.                         18:29:11

                 7           MR. GREASON:  Because of lack of         18:29:15

                 8   results.                                         18:29:18

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  Because of lack of         18:29:18

                10   results.  I mean, you know, we're just going     18:29:20

                11   to go an entire decade before something gets     18:29:22

                12   flown there in the '20s as it's currently now    18:29:22

                13   structured.  The ISS would be about a -- that    18:29:24

                14   is to say, 3B would be about a zero.             18:29:27

                15           And I think 3B star (sic) -- here you    18:29:31

                16   have to weigh how much support you'll get for    18:29:36

                17   the continuation of the shuttle-based system.    18:29:41

                18   I'm sorry.  No.  I'm sorry.  I misspoke.         18:29:45

                19           3B star does not have the                18:29:49

                20   shuttle-based system.  So I think we'd call      18:29:52

                21   that a zero.  And 5$, you would probably take    18:29:55

                22   some credit for the shuttle extension, I         18:30:05

                23   would think.                                     18:30:08

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  A one or something.      18:30:09

                25           DR. CRAWLEY:  Let's call that a one.     18:30:13





                                                               302



                 1           MR. AUGUSTINE:  And then you'd bump      18:30:16

                 2   up the yellows to zero, minus one and one.       18:30:16

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     18:30:20

                 4           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.                    18:30:20

                 5           DR. CRAWLEY:  So let me read that        18:30:20

                 6   back --                                          18:30:24

                 7           DR. AUSTIN:  Can I be just a little      18:30:24

                 8   argumentative here for a moment.  You know, I    18:30:24

                 9   believe there's a cadre of people that would     18:30:32

                10   argue shuttle extension slows us down from       18:30:32

                11   doing other things that we'd like to do.         18:30:32

                12           So I don't know that it uniformly        18:30:40

                13   would be viewed as something that would          18:30:40

                14   support.                                         18:30:51

                15           DR. CRAWLEY:  You're absolutely          18:30:51

                16   right.  And I'm trying to think about the way    18:30:51

                17   to say this without sounding like a              18:30:51

                18   professor.                                       18:30:51

                19           What I want to say is you've got to      18:30:57

                20   decide whether it's the partial derivative or    18:30:57

                21   the total derivative.                            18:30:57

                22           MR. GREASON:  You were unsuccessful      18:31:02

                23   in that --                                       18:31:02

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  Thank you for that.        18:31:02

                25           DR. RIDE:  I think an engineer could     18:31:05





                                                               303



                 1   probably understand that one too.                18:31:08

                 2           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think it's the         18:31:08

                 3   partial derivative.                              18:31:10

                 4           DR. CRAWLEY:  In the sense that --       18:31:10

                 5   really the way we sort of set this up, Wanda,    18:31:10

                 6   I think, is that each of these should be         18:31:14

                 7   judged as an individual consideration rather     18:31:16

                 8   than coupling it back through a bunch of --      18:31:16

                 9           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Partial derivative.      18:31:16

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  So if you just     18:31:20

                11   looked at the policy aspects independent of      18:31:20

                12   schedule change and -- you know, would it be     18:31:23

                13   more difficult to find advocacy for this one     18:31:26

                14   or that one.                                     18:31:28

                15           DR. AUSTIN:  Right.                      18:31:30

                16           DR. CRAWLEY:  Did I do that better       18:31:32

                17   that time?                                       18:31:34

                18           DR. AUSTIN:  Yeah.  That was -- you      18:31:34

                19   could run for office now.                        18:31:35

                20           MR. GREASON:  I want to make a very      18:31:35

                21   quick comment just -- it doesn't change          18:31:37

                22   anything -- about this whole notion of, you      18:31:39

                23   know, contract disruption as an element of       18:31:42

                24   Sustainability.  It's real.  The people who      18:31:46

                25   are losing something always fight harder than    18:31:53





                                                               304



                 1   the -- against it than the people who are        18:31:53

                 2   gaining something will fight for it --           18:31:53

                 3   always.                                          18:31:55

                 4           But it's -- having that under            18:31:56

                 5   Sustainability is an odd place to book-keep      18:32:03

                 6   it, because those are sort of transitional       18:32:06

                 7   pain.  You know, four or five years down the     18:32:09

                 8   road that's all over and the new winners         18:32:13

                 9   become the established stakeholders and the      18:32:17

                10   old losers have moved on.                        18:32:21

                11           And so while it's a real effect and      18:32:22

                12   it drives a figure of merit, it's just a --      18:32:22

                13   the nomenclature is strange.                     18:32:24

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well --                    18:32:24

                15           MR. GREASON:  So I vote we note it       18:32:37

                16   and move on.                                     18:32:40

                17           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  Thank you.          18:32:42

                18           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Safety/Success.          18:32:42

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  So let's review            18:32:42

                20   Sustainability.  2 is a minus one.  3B has a     18:32:47

                21   zero.  3B$ also has a zero.  5$ has a one.       18:32:54

                22   6$ has a zero.  7$ has a minus one.  And 7S$     18:32:59

                23   has a one.                                       18:33:08

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  One.                     18:33:12

                25           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.                      18:33:12





                                                               305



                 1           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Sold.                    18:33:15

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  Now, this is -- the        18:33:15

                 3   next category of Safety and Mission Success      18:33:17

                 4   and so forth is --                               18:33:20

                 5           MR. BEJMUK:  Ed, are you saying          18:33:22

                 6   that -- say it, again, what 7 and -- 7 is        18:33:23

                 7   one?                                             18:33:27

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  7S$ is one.                18:33:27

                 9           MR. BEJMUK:  Oh, okay.                   18:33:32

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  Now, in the        18:33:33

                11   Safety category there has been quite a debate    18:33:37

                12   which has gone back and forth within the         18:33:44

                13   subgroup that was working on defining these      18:33:46

                14   metrics, which Wanda alluded to in her           18:33:50

                15   introduction of them yesterday.                  18:33:57

                16           MR. BEJMUK:  I have a suggestion         18:34:00

                17   to --                                            18:34:00

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  Earlier today, I guess     18:34:01

                19   it was.                                          18:34:02

                20           MR. BEJMUK:  Ed, I have a suggestion     18:34:03

                21   to make life easier.  Everything that has a      18:34:05

                22   commercial crew, minus one.  Everything that     18:34:09

                23   has a refueling, minus two.  It's a good         18:34:12

                24   starting point.                                  18:34:15

                25           MR. GREASON:  I oppose that              18:34:15





                                                               306



                 1   suggestion.                                      18:34:18

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  So here are the -- here    18:34:18

                 3   is the idea that's captured in Wanda's           18:34:21

                 4   rubrics.  First, that this is -- this is loss    18:34:25

                 5   of crew and loss of mission for the entire       18:34:31

                 6   mission, not just ascent, right.                 18:34:34

                 7           So making an assertion, which we did     18:34:36

                 8   in the rubric, that zero was a loss of crew      18:34:41

                 9   comparable to the shuttle is actually            18:34:44

                10   synonymous with saying that we have a far        18:34:47

                11   more reliable launch system -- because there     18:34:51

                12   are so many other things that the crew will      18:34:53

                13   be exposed to as potential hazards that if       18:34:55

                14   the whole system ends up being comparable to     18:34:58

                15   the shuttle, we'll have done well, right.        18:35:05

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I don't see how, for     18:35:07

                17   example, circumnavigating Mars doesn't have      18:35:07

                18   to be much more risky than flying a shuttle.     18:35:13

                19           MR. GREASON:  And in some of these       18:35:20

                20   scenarios --                                     18:35:20

                21           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Given the choice,        18:35:25

                22   which would you rather do?                       18:35:25

                23           DR. CRAWLEY:  Both.                      18:35:25

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  See, that's why          18:35:31

                25   you're not an astronaut and these two are.       18:35:31

                 1           DR. CHIAO:  Well, I've done shuttle.     18:35:31

                 2   I'll go around Mars.                             18:35:31

                 3           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  Me too.                18:35:40

                 4           MR. AUGUSTINE:  We're going to get       18:35:40

                 5   you both another shot at it.  You know, John     18:35:40

                 6   Glenn got a second bite at the apple.  You       18:35:40

                 7   may yet.                                         18:35:40

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  Well, we'll talk    18:35:40

                 9   about that later.                                18:35:51

                10           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Shouldn't they be a      18:35:51

                11   minus one or something?                          18:35:51

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, the other point,     18:35:51

                13   which maybe is the one Wanda should make         18:35:51

                14   because it's her point -- there's actually       18:36:00

                15   two issues.                                      18:36:00

                16           One is that at the level of analysis     18:36:00

                17   that we've done it's actually very difficult     18:36:00

                18   to figure out the relative hazards and safety    18:36:00

                19   levels of these concepts.                        18:36:08

                20           MR. AUGUSTINE:  But you can do a         18:36:08

                21   relative mission challenge -- mission            18:36:08

                22   difficulty, and certainly the yellow ones are    18:36:15

                23   more difficult missions than the shuttle.        18:36:15

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, the yellow ones      18:36:19

                25   involve two launches from planetary surfaces.    18:36:22





                                                               308



                 1           MR. AUGUSTINE:  That's what I said.      18:36:28

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  I'm sorry.  The blue       18:36:28

                 3   ones -- the blue ones, you land and take off     18:36:28

                 4   twice.  Those are the riskiest part of human     18:36:34

                 5   space flight.  The yellow one, you only land     18:36:34

                 6   and take off once.                               18:36:41

                 7           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, that may be.       18:36:41

                 8   I'm just arguing that there shouldn't be         18:36:41

                 9   zeroes.  There should be negatives on these      18:36:41

                10   things.                                          18:36:50

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  Oh, that they're all       18:36:50

                12   more risky -- they're all riskier than flying    18:36:50

                13   in the shuttle?                                  18:36:50

                14           MR. AUGUSTINE:  That would be my         18:36:50

                15   view.  Here are the two experts.  So we --       18:36:50

                16           MR. GREASON:  That can't be right.       18:37:03

                17   Because one of these options is, you know, we    18:37:03

                18   just -- we don't do anything except go to ISS    18:37:03

                19   for rest of the time.  You know, that better     18:37:03

                20   not be more risky than what we're doing now.     18:37:11

                21           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I sure hope not.         18:37:11

                22           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah.  3B and 5 were         18:37:11

                23   zeroes.                                          18:37:11

                24           MR. McALISTER:  Just the yellow          18:37:11

                25   options were minus.                              18:37:11





                                                               309



                 1           MR. GREASON:  Okay.                      18:37:11

                 2           MR. McALISTER:  Not all of them,         18:37:11

                 3   right?                                           18:37:11

                 4           MR. AUGUSTINE:  No.  I think             18:37:11

                 5   everything -- well, let's see.  The ones that    18:37:18

                 6   just go to the space station, I guess, could     18:37:18

                 7   be a zero, but the rest of them, I think, are    18:37:18

                 8   minus ones.  Anyway...                           18:37:27

                 9           MR. GREASON:  Well, none of the          18:37:27

                10   options for crew transport to the ISS,           18:37:27

                11   commercial or government, lack the addition      18:37:27

                12   of a serious escape capability.  So if those     18:37:36

                13   aren't significantly safer than the shuttle,     18:37:39

                14   we're doing something wrong.                     18:37:42

                15           DR. CHIAO:  And, Ed, you kind of         18:37:44

                16   changed the numbers after our discussion.        18:37:45

                17   Because we had talked about -- because the       18:37:47

                18   commercials are unknown, we had said that        18:37:50

                19   that's probably a little less safe just          18:37:50

                20   because --                                       18:37:53

                21           DR. CRAWLEY:  You're right.  I did       18:37:53

                22   that.                                            18:37:53

                23           DR. CHIAO:  -- just because we don't     18:37:53

                24   know and they don't have a pedigree.  I would    18:37:53

                25   almost say that this Safety, you know, should    18:38:01





                                                               310



                 1   be moved over with the other things because      18:38:03

                 2   we just don't know with the -- I mean, with      18:38:03

                 3   the schedule program risk and life cycle         18:38:05

                 4   costs, which are left undefined, because I       18:38:08

                 5   don't know how we --                             18:38:10

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, the schedule life    18:38:12

                 7   cycle costs are intended that we will fill in    18:38:14

                 8   when we get the data, I guess.  I mean, now      18:38:16

                 9   you're actually coming back to Wanda's           18:38:18

                10   original position --                             18:38:20

                11           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah.                        18:38:20

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- which is that you       18:38:21

                13   basically set a safety criteria --               18:38:22

                14           MR. GREASON:  And it's not a             18:38:26

                15   differentiator.                                  18:38:27

                16           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- and it's not a          18:38:29

                17   differentiator, that you would not fly crew      18:38:31

                18   unless you could convince yourself in one of     18:38:33

                19   these concepts --                                18:38:37

                20           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, maybe we should    18:38:37

                21   change the title to be Safety Success            18:38:37

                22   Challenge -- the challenge.  Because as you      18:38:42

                23   say, they're all going to be safe or we won't    18:38:42

                24   do them.                                         18:38:47

                25           On the other hand, the challenge is      18:38:47





                                                               311



                 1   something that's just a lot greater, and         18:38:47

                 2   that's important in making a decision.           18:38:53

                 3           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah.  There's difficulty    18:38:53

                 4   in making it safe enough to go.                  18:38:53

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Exactly.                 18:38:58

                 6           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  And safety -- I        18:38:58

                 7   mean, it's interesting to lump these -- a        18:38:58

                 8   whole scenario into one number on safety.        18:39:04

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     18:39:04

                10           DR. RIDE:  Because every scenario        18:39:08

                11   includes getting the crew to and from LEO.       18:39:11

                12           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Right.                   18:39:11

                13           DR. RIDE:  And most of these             18:39:16

                14   scenarios involve taking people a long way       18:39:20

                15   out and exposing them to significantly higher    18:39:25

                16   risks for a variety of different reasons.        18:39:25

                17   You know, so --                                  18:39:31

                18           MR. GREASON:  Apollo would clearly       18:39:31

                19   not score as comparable to the shuttle in        18:39:35

                20   safety, if you were to take an honest look at    18:39:31

                21   it.                                              18:39:31

                22           DR. RIDE:  A what?                       18:39:31

                23           MR. GREASON:  Apollo would clearly       18:39:33

                24   not score as --                                  18:39:35

                25           DR. RIDE:  Right.  Yeah.  That's         18:39:36





                                                               312



                 1   right.                                           18:39:36

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  And you see --             18:39:41

                 3           MR. AUGUSTINE:  And, yet, Apollo was     18:39:41

                 4   ten for ten, and the shuttle is two for --       18:39:41

                 5   or --                                            18:39:48

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  So what you've      18:39:48

                 7   sort of done is define this as hazards in the    18:39:48

                 8   safety arena, right.  This is the hazards        18:39:53

                 9   analysis, what hazards will be encountered.      18:40:00

                10           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.  You could call    18:40:00

                11   it Safety Success Hazards -- whatever -- or      18:40:00

                12   the challenge.                                   18:40:10

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  But now the problem is,    18:40:10

                14   you know, do we have actually enough insight     18:40:10

                15   to know that it's more hazardous to spend        18:40:10

                16   180 days in free space as opposed to 180 days    18:40:10

                17   on a planetary surface --                        18:40:16

                18           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.                    18:40:16

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- which are both in       18:40:16

                20   the plan?                                        18:40:16

                21           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Because you have to      18:40:16

                22   land on the planetary surface.                   18:40:16

                23           DR. RIDE:  Land and get off again.       18:40:16

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  You've got to get off    18:40:16

                25   of it.                                           18:40:21





                                                               313



                 1           MR. GREASON:  Yeah.  But then the        18:40:21

                 2   radiation risks are a large unknown and are a    18:40:21

                 3   bigger problem in deep space than they are on    18:40:24

                 4   the planetary surface.                           18:40:28

                 5           DR. CHIAO:  Right.                       18:40:28

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  Because you have twice     18:40:28

                 7   the galactic cosmic -- cosmic galactic           18:40:30

                 8   radiation.                                       18:40:32

                 9           MR. BEJMUK:  But in going back to        18:40:32

                10   this refueling, I have a problem accepting       18:40:35

                11   the fact that fueling on the ground and          18:40:35

                12   flying is not safer than fueling on the          18:40:39

                13   ground, flying and then trying to refuel it      18:40:46

                14   again in space.  It's a huge complexity.  And    18:40:46

                15   if you were to try to write hazard analysis,     18:40:51

                16   you know, you'd do it forever almost.            18:40:59

                17           So I think there should be a             18:40:59

                18   differentiation between those that do and --     18:40:59

                19   and from those that do not require refueling     18:41:05

                20   on orbit or in space.                            18:41:10

                21           DR. RIDE:  Well, I'm not sure that       18:41:10

                22   that -- you know, given the overall              18:41:10

                23   complexity of each of the scenarios, I'm not     18:41:20

                24   certain that the refueling ones -- just          18:41:20

                25   looking only at the refueling, I'd say it's      18:41:20





                                                               314



                 1   less safe.                                       18:41:20

                 2           You know, that -- I mean, space          18:41:30

                 3   station -- we've learned to do an                18:41:30

                 4   unbelievable number of things on space           18:41:30

                 5   station.  I mean, it's absolutely incredible,    18:41:30

                 6   you know, what we're able to do with EVAs and    18:41:38

                 7   also with robotics and just putting things       18:41:38

                 8   together and moving things around.  I mean,      18:41:45

                 9   it's incredible.                                 18:41:45

                10           So we've learned a ton and we'll         18:41:45

                11   learn a lot more that are going to help          18:41:51

                12   mitigate those risks.                            18:41:51

                13           But, you know, my main point is, you     18:41:51

                14   know, for these scenarios that envision          18:41:55

                15   refueling, that's really just a part of it,      18:41:57

                16   and the ones that don't may have 180-day         18:42:03

                17   transit times with exposure to galactic          18:42:08

                18   radiation.  They may have, you know,             18:42:10

                19   different landing scenarios.  They may have      18:42:13

                20   launch scenarios that are riskier.               18:42:15

                21           So there's just -- you know, I'm         18:42:18

                22   actually right back on zeroes for all of them    18:42:19

                23   because I don't know how to differentiate        18:42:25

                24   because they're -- you know, we're really        18:42:26

                25   talking apples and oranges within every          18:42:27





                                                               315



                 1   different scenario --                            18:42:27

                 2           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah.  That's the            18:42:27

                 3   problem.                                         18:42:27

                 4           DR. RIDE:  -- and then, you know,        18:42:27

                 5   pears and kumquats from scenario to scenario     18:42:30

                 6   but -- and this is -- it's too -- you know,      18:42:34

                 7   it's too simplistic a system and too complex     18:42:37

                 8   a problem to try to differentiate, and there     18:42:43

                 9   are -- you know, basically exploration is        18:42:47

                10   risky.  Space flight is risky.  We're going      18:42:47

                11   to do it as safely as we can or we're not        18:42:50

                12   going to be doing it.                            18:42:54

                13           DR. AUSTIN:  I would say that, for       18:42:54

                14   all of the options we have, we didn't see        18:42:54

                15   anything that said we could not get              18:43:00

                16   comfortable, that we could design it to be       18:43:00

                17   safe.                                            18:43:00

                18           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah.  And that's why        18:43:00

                19   like Norm's suggestion.  Let's change this to    18:43:04

                20   kind of the challenge of what it would --        18:43:04

                21   your difficulty factor of --                     18:43:05

                22           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Right.                   18:43:05

                23           DR. CHIAO:  -- getting it to that        18:43:07

                24   point.                                           18:43:09

                25           MR. AUGUSTINE:  If you do --             18:43:09





                                                               316



                 1           DR. CHIAO:  You can kind of --           18:43:09

                 2           MR. GREASON:  If you could even          18:43:10

                 3   narrow -- we have such huge uncertainty          18:43:10

                 4   over -- I mean, just over which elements are     18:43:11

                 5   really the hard ones to go solve.                18:43:14

                 6           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, let's --           18:43:17

                 7           DR. CHIAO:  But, I mean, you look at     18:43:21

                 8   ISS -- and I don't care -- we're going back      18:43:21

                 9   to ISS with a -- you know, either shuttle or     18:43:23

                10   something like that --                           18:43:25

                11           MR. GREASON:  Yeah.  If you say going    18:43:27

                12   to the ISS is easier than going into             18:43:27

                13   Deep Space, whoo-hoo.                            18:43:28

                14           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         18:43:30

                15           DR. CHIAO:  But then if you -- well,     18:43:30

                16   and I have to agree with Bo.  I mean, if         18:43:30

                17   you're going to do refueling, maybe that's       18:43:33

                18   something that will turn out to be relatively    18:43:37

                19   easy to do, but, nonetheless, you've added       18:43:40

                20   that operation.  So by definition --             18:43:40

                21           MR. McALISTER:  As a hazard.             18:43:42

                22           DR. CHIAO:  -- it's a little more        18:43:42

                23   difficult.                                       18:43:42

                24           MR. BEJMUK:  It's a hazard to the --     18:43:42

                25           DR. CRAWLEY:  You know, and, Sally, I    18:43:42

                 1   think I have to support Bo on this, that, you    18:43:45

                 2   know, the comparison between transferring        18:43:48

                 3   water and so forth in the space station as       18:43:50

                 4   opposed to fueling a deep cryogenic stage on     18:43:52

                 5   orbit --

                 6           MR. McALISTER:  Well, cryo is a

                 7   different thing, you know.

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, that's what

                 9   refueling is.

                10           MR. McALISTER:  Well, but, I mean, if    18:43:58

                11   we're talking --                                 18:43:58

                12           DR. CHIAO:  It depends on the fuel.      18:44:00

                13   Because on the station, we do UDMH and --        18:44:02

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, no.  But the fuel    18:44:04

                15   we're talking about is liquid hydrogen.          18:44:05

                16           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah.  Liquid hydrogen is    18:44:05

                17   a whole different thing.                         18:44:05

                18           MR. McALISTER:  And we have received     18:44:05

                19   testimony after testimony on --                  18:44:07

                20           MR. BEJMUK:  Do you know how many        18:44:07

                21   launches are scratched on the ground because

                22   of hydrogen leakage?

                23           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I

                24   know.

                25           MR. BEJMUK:  On ground.

                 4           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, you've got a       18:44:18

                 5   lot of air around on the ground, and you         18:44:18

                 6   don't in space.                                  18:44:18

                 7           (Discussion off the record.)             18:44:26

                 8           MR. AUGUSTINE:  How about this.          18:44:26

                 9   We're not trying to compare these things with    18:44:34

                10   each other.                                      18:44:36

                11           We're trying to compare -- or let me     18:44:37

                12   propose that we compare the challenge of         18:44:41

                13   doing this and we're not comparing them so       18:44:44

                14   much with each other as we are -- it says        18:44:47

                15   here, risk compared to the shuttle.              18:44:49

                16           And so the ISS flights get a zero.       18:44:52

                17   Everything else, I give a minus two, just        18:44:57

                18   because it's that much more difficult than       18:45:00

                19   flying a shuttle.                                18:45:03

                20           DR. AUSTIN:  But a minus two would       18:45:05

                21   say we wouldn't do it or that we would advise    18:45:08

                22   against it, I guess, as opposed to --            18:45:12

                23           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, maybe --           18:45:12

                24           MR. McALISTER:  But it's the             18:45:12

                25   challenge.  It's not -- remember we changed      18:45:12

                 1   it.                                              18:45:12

                 2           DR. AUSTIN:  Okay.                       18:45:18

                 3           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Challenge.  We're        18:45:18

                 4   going to meet the challenge and make them all    18:45:18

                 5   zeroes, as Sally says.                           18:45:18

                 6           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah.  I mean, it's          18:45:29

                 7   almost like we could rename this Technical       18:45:29

                 8   Challenge instead of Safety and Mission          18:45:29

                 9   Success, because we're going to try to --        18:45:29

                10   we're going to do this --                        18:45:29

                11           MR. GREASON:  No.  It's the              18:45:29

                12   challenges that are associated with creating     18:45:29

                13   hazards that impact life and --                  18:45:29

                14           DR. CHIAO:  Well, we're dealing          18:45:29

                15   with -- technically dealing with those           18:45:29

                16   technical --                                     18:45:37

                17           MR. AUGUSTINE:  But there are other      18:45:37

                18   technical challenges that we wouldn't want to    18:45:37

                19   weigh in on here, I think.                       18:45:37

                20           MR. McALISTER:  Yeah.  Let's keep it     18:45:37

                21   then.                                            18:45:37

                22           (Discussion off the record.)             18:45:41

                23           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Safety challenge,        18:45:41

                24   two.  Space station is a zero because that's     18:45:43

                25   comparable to shuttle, and everything else is    18:45:46





                                                               320



                 1   a minus two.                                     18:45:49

                 2           But then we make the point that that     18:45:49

                 3   doesn't mean you're going to live with that.     18:45:52

                 4           DR. CRAWLEY:  I mean, if you look at     18:45:56

                 5   the rubrics that Wanda derived, maybe it's       18:46:00

                 6   one and minus one.  Because the rubric for       18:46:00

                 7   one is enhanced crew safety consistent with      18:46:03

                 8   new human rating requirements.                   18:46:03

                 9           Now, I realize that really is a          18:46:08

                10   safety -- not a hazards -- statement, right.     18:46:08

                11           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, I think we've      18:46:08

                12   got to redefine this block to be consistent      18:46:12

                13   with the notion of challenge as opposed to       18:46:12

                14   mission success.                                 18:46:19

                15           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.                      18:46:19

                16           MR. GREASON:  Either way, it's a         18:46:24

                17   Delta 2.                                         18:46:24

                18           MR. BEJMUK:  Well, but, you know, if     18:46:24

                19   you redefine it as challenge, you even more      18:46:24

                20   should be concerned about these missions that    18:46:24

                21   involve refueling in space.                      18:46:31

                22           (Discussion off the record.)

                23           MR. BEJMUK:  To get this refueling in

                24   space done and GN&C and Ground and Mission

                25   Control and sensors -- I mean, you know --

                 1   and you have to do it so you don't collide

                 2   and so you transfer safely.

                 3           To me, it's a huge safety risk.  It

                 4   sounds like coming to a gas station and

                 5   filling your car, and I --                       18:47:01

                 6           MR. AUGUSTINE:  To draw this to a        18:47:02

                 7   close, why don't we redefine this challenge,     18:47:04

                 8   show it's a much greater challenge than the      18:47:07

                 9   shuttle, and change the wording here so that     18:47:10

                10   it matches the challenge as opposed to an        18:47:13

                11   assessment of the safety.                        18:47:16

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  I have to say I have to    18:47:16

                13   agree with Bo on this.  I think that             18:47:16

                14   someplace on here -- if we're taking the         18:47:18

                15   credit for the fuel transfer, multiple           18:47:21

                16   vehicle operations with smaller vehicles, we     18:47:25

                17   have to someplace show the associated risk       18:47:26

                18   with that.                                       18:47:30

                19           MR. GREASON:  Well, you already          18:47:32

                20   scored it lower on Sustainability, quote,        18:47:32

                21   unquote.                                         18:47:33

                22           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Or you can make it       18:47:33

                23   minus one and minus two if you want.  If         18:47:36

                24   you're going to transfer fuel, you make it       18:47:36

                25   minus two.  Everything else is a minus one.      18:47:40

                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  We scored it low on        18:47:41

                 2   Sustainability because of the transition in      18:47:45

                 3   contractual arrangements, not having anything    18:47:47

                 4   to do with the fact that it had big tanks or     18:47:49

                 5   small tanks.                                     18:47:51

                 6           MR. GREASON:  Just let me say this,      18:47:51

                 7   and then I will bow out, okay.                   18:47:53

                 8           We have never seen a scenario -- I       18:47:54

                 9   mean, we say we're trying to go to Mars.  We     18:47:58

                10   have never seen a credible scenario that does    18:48:01

                11   not involve propellant transfer in space.        18:48:04

                12   None.                                            18:48:07

                13           So, you know, we can make all of the     18:48:07

                14   song and dance we want about, oh, my God,        18:48:09

                15   it's hard -- and it may be.  It may be really    18:48:13

                16   hard.  Guess what?  If we're serious, we have    18:48:16

                17   no choice.                                       18:48:22

                18           DR. CHIAO:  Well, I don't think --       18:48:22

                19   rating it down doesn't mean we're not going      18:48:22

                20   to do it.  No.  I mean, just I think it's --     18:48:25

                21   we're trying to do a relative risk.              18:48:25

                22           MR. GREASON:  So with that, I will       18:48:32

                23   acquiesce.                                       18:48:32

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  Well, let me        18:48:32

                25   make a suggestion and see how it works here.     18:48:32

                 1           Which is that I think we should call     18:48:36

                 2   the ISS Focused on a one under the principle     18:48:36

                 3   that going up and down to the ISS in a new       18:48:45

                 4   vehicle should -- new vehicle in the -- well,    18:48:47

                 5   now it's whether they are hazards or failure     18:48:49

                 6   effects.                                         18:48:53

                 7           What I was trying to get to is that,     18:48:58

                 8   you know, doing it in a new vehicle would be     18:49:00

                 9   less hazardous because the vehicle would have    18:49:00

                10   been developed under the new standards, but      18:49:02

                11   I'm not sure I'm --                              18:49:03

                12           MR. AUGUSTINE:  That's what they         18:49:04

                13   thought about the shuttle.                       18:49:08

                15           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  So let's do         18:49:08

                16   it --                                            18:49:14

                17           DR. RIDE:  Never assess safety until     18:49:14

                 8   3B ISS Focused, commercial crew, et cetera,      18:49:29

                 9   it's a zero.  I would recommend that the ones    18:49:34

                10   that involve either going in the yellow zone     18:49:38

                11   or the blue zone to be minus one but that the    18:49:44

                12   ones that involve significantly more fueling     18:49:48

                13   and launch operations in order to do that get    18:49:52

                14   minus two.                                       18:49:56

                15           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I could live with        18:49:56

                16   that.                                            18:49:59

                17           MR. McALISTER:  Before we go on to       18:49:59

                18   the next one, Ed, just a point of                18:50:02

                19   clarification.  You may be surprised to hear     18:50:08

                20   that we still have an audience on NASA TV.       18:50:08

                21           And in terms of the dollar signs,        18:50:14

                22   that is consistent with the less constrained     18:50:14

                23   options.  Is that correct?                       18:50:18

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yes.  That's right.        18:50:18

                25           MR. McALISTER:  Okay.  So we have the    18:50:18





                                                               325



                 1   constrained options which fit within the         18:50:18

                 2   budget.  Then we had unconstrained, which we     18:50:23

                 3   have eliminated.  And now the ones with the      18:50:23

                 4   dollar sign are in the less constrained          18:50:24

                 5   category consistent with Sally's presentation    18:50:26

                 6   earlier where we bumped it up to what we         18:50:29

                 7   thought was a reasonable level, just so          18:50:32

                 8   people can follow along on NASA TV.              18:50:34

                 9           Okay.  Keep going, Ed.  Thanks.          18:50:37

                10           DR. AUSTIN:  Do you want to call it      18:50:41

                11   out, Ed, on Safety?                              18:50:42

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  I'm trying to       18:50:42

                13   figure out what the actual implication --        18:50:44

                14           MR. McALISTER:  It was the 5 --          18:50:44

                15           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         18:50:44

                16           MR. McALISTER:  -- 5$ and 3B$.  Since    18:50:44

                17   they're not on the sheet, that's where people    18:50:47

                18   were confused.                                   18:50:49

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  So let's start      18:50:52

                20   from the top by those rules.                     18:50:55

                21           The program of record would be a         18:50:57

                22   minus one.  That's No. 2.  3B would be a         18:51:01

                23   zero.  The shuttle extension would be --         18:51:12

                24           MR. McALISTER:  That's 5.                18:51:16

                25           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.                      18:51:16





                                                               326



                 1           MR. McALISTER:  5$.                      18:51:20

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  It's 5$.                   18:51:21

                 3           MR. GREASON:  I'm sorry to do this to    18:51:21

                 4   you, Ed.  But if No. 2, which is the             18:51:23

                 5   constrained to the budget -- we don't            18:51:26

                 6   actually ever go beyond ISS in that option.      18:51:28

                 7           DR. CRAWLEY:  That's true.               18:51:31

                 8           DR. RIDE:  It's a point.                 18:51:31

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  Do we give it credit       18:51:36

                10   for going nowhere?                               18:51:36

                11           MR. McALISTER:  It's 2028.               18:51:39

                12           DR. RIDE:  Sure.                         18:51:39

                13           MR. GREASON:  To use this whole, if      18:51:44

                14   take with the one hand, you have to give with    18:51:44

                15   other, I think, yeah.                            18:51:44

                16           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         18:51:44

                17           MR. GREASON:  It's not like we scored    18:51:47

                18   it for all of the things it wanted to do.        18:51:47

                19           MR. McALISTER:  I thought Ares V flew    18:51:51

                20   in 2028.                                         18:51:54

                21           MR. GREASON:  But it doesn't leave       18:51:58

                22   LEO because it's got nowhere to go.              18:52:01

                23           MR. AUGUSTINE:  It doesn't go            18:52:01

                24   anywhere.  It doesn't have anything to --        18:52:01

                25           DR. RIDE:  It's ready.                   18:52:01





                                                               327



                 1           MR. McALISTER:  Yeah.  All right.        18:52:01

                 2           MR. AUGUSTINE:  It's all dressed up.     18:52:01

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.                      18:52:04

                 4           MR. McALISTER:  Yeah.  I can live        18:52:04

                 5   with that.  Our standards are going down.        18:52:04

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  What I'm struggling        18:52:08

                 7   with here is whether we differentiate in         18:52:11

                 8   terms of this operational complexity the         18:52:11

                 9   shuttle-derived vehicles and the EELVs from      18:52:17

                10   the Ares or do we put the shuttle-derived        18:52:21

                11   vehicles at about 108-ton capacity with the      18:52:26

                12   Ares and differentiate the other one.  It's      18:52:29

                13   almost like --                                   18:52:31

                14           MR. GREASON:  Are they different only    18:52:31

                15   by one?                                          18:52:31

                16           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.                      18:52:32

                17           MR. GREASON:  I don't care.              18:52:34

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  Well, okay.         18:52:36

                19   Then here's my proposal that -- and remind me    18:52:38

                20   what 3B$ is.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  So       18:52:43

                21   that would be a minus one.  Okay.                18:52:47

                22           So here's the proposal -- that No. 2     18:52:48

                23   gets a zero by virtue of the fact that it        18:52:54

                24   doesn't get anywhere.                            18:52:57

                25           No. 3B gets a zero by virtue of the      18:53:01





                                                               328



                 1   fact that it's just going up and down to the     18:53:07

                 2   space station.  The shuttle extension -- I'm     18:53:12

                 3   sorry.                                           18:53:12

                 4           3B$ gets a minus one because of the      18:53:12

                 5   inherent risks of going towards the Moon.        18:53:22

                 6           5$ also gets a minus one due to the      18:53:22

                 7   inherent risks of going to the Moon.             18:53:22

                 8           6$ gets a minus one due to the           18:53:31

                 9   inherent risks in going various places away      18:53:31

                10   from the Earth.                                  18:53:31

                11           And the other two get minus twos         18:53:31

                12   because of both the inherent risks of going      18:53:38

                13   those places and the complexity -- except I      18:53:38

                14   mis-scored the shuttle extension.  So let me     18:53:45

                15   do that again.                                   18:53:45

                16           No. 2 -- well, Norm said we'd be here    18:53:45

                17   until midnight.  I think we'll make it by        18:53:52

                18   9:00.                                            18:53:52

                19           No. 2 is zero.  No. 3B is zero.          18:53:52

                20   No. 3B$ that gets out of low Earth orbit is      18:54:02

                21   minus one.  No. 5$, which gets out of low        18:54:02

                22   Earth orbit and has the operational              18:54:13

                23   complexity, is minus two.                        18:54:13

                24           DR. AUSTIN:  Minus two?                  18:54:13

                25           DR. CRAWLEY:  Minus two.  The            18:54:23





                                                               329



                 1   Deep Space 6 star -- 6$ is minus one.  The       18:54:23

                 2   7$ is minus two.  And the 7S$ is minus two.      18:54:23

                 3   Unless you just wanted to take all of those      18:54:29

                 4   and add one so that instead of having zero,      18:54:36

                 5   minus one and minus two, you had minus one,      18:54:36

                 6   zero and plus one.                               18:54:36

                 7           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think you better       18:54:36

                 8   leave it the way it is.                          18:54:44

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  Leave it the way it is.    18:54:44

                10           MR. BEJMUK:  Yeah.  It's good.           18:54:44

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  Now, the next       18:54:44

                12   category is NASA and Industry Workforce.         18:54:44

                13           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Here's one, Ed, I        18:54:51

                14   might interject -- the changes we've been        18:54:51

                15   working on, we've really broken that into two    18:54:51

                16   columns.  One is critical skills, which is       18:54:59

                17   the next one here, and the first one is the      18:54:59

                18   NASA workforce.  And those are just going to     18:54:59

                19   fall out of the dollars.                         18:55:08

                20           So there's really no -- the ratings      18:55:08

                21   are going to come out automatically from the     18:55:08

                22   computer.  So I don't think we have to do        18:55:08

                23   anything on those.  I think the computer will    18:55:24

                24   fill in the blanks.                              18:55:24

                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  I'll tell you --    18:55:24

                 2   you notice my notation down there on the HC,     18:55:24

                 3   which I think merits a little discussion         18:55:24

                 4   before we go -- I think the workforce one --     18:55:40

                 5   you're right, Norm.  I think the workforce       18:55:40

                 6   one approximation is dollars.                    18:55:40

                 7           MR. AUGUSTINE:  You know, you're         18:55:40

                 8   right.  I misspoke.  You're absolutely right.    18:55:40

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  I think the skills --      18:55:40

                10           MR. AUGUSTINE:  The skills one is        18:55:40

                11   different.                                       18:55:40

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- is a little             18:55:40

                13   different.                                       18:55:40

                14           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Absolutely.              18:55:40

                15           DR. CRAWLEY:  So in order to             18:55:40

                16   highlight that difference -- you see that        18:55:56

                17   little annotation there?  I couldn't figure      18:55:56

                18   out whether I'd score 7 -- Scenario 7 as a       18:55:56

                19   plus one or minus one.  And here was the         18:55:56

                20   reasoning.                                       18:55:56

                21           It's a plus one because you train a      18:55:56

                22   whole generation of people to build a new big    18:55:56

                23   hydrocarbon engine, and it's a minus one         18:56:08

                24   because you lose the solids.  So is that a --    18:56:08

                25   so it's a value judgment as to which part of     18:56:08





                                                               331



                 1   the skilled workforce is more important.         18:56:08

                 2           I don't mean to put such a sharp edge    18:56:18

                 3   on it, but there's a flavor of that that         18:56:18

                 4   there's a value judgment about what is the       18:56:18

                 5   skilled workforce you have to maintain before    18:56:24

                 6   it makes sense to rate this, which is            18:56:24

                 7   unfortunately --                                 18:56:24

                 8           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think you can build    18:56:24

                 9   the argument that being good in one area         18:56:31

                10   doesn't offset being poor in another area.       18:56:31

                11   So I would give it the lower number.             18:56:40

                12           You know, you can't offset not being     18:56:40

                13   able to build microchips by being good at        18:56:40

                14   energy propellants.  So I think that gets        18:56:40

                15   taken down.                                      18:56:52

                16           DR. CRAWLEY:  So you would look at       18:56:52

                17   the most important or severe loss of a key       18:56:54

                18   national skill as the way you would rate it?     18:56:58

                19           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think for the level    18:57:01

                20   of detail we're doing here that's what I'd       18:57:06

                21   do.  I'd give it a minus one.                    18:57:06

                22           MR. GREASON:  I mean, politically --     18:57:09

                23   again, you know, stakeholders losing             18:57:12

                24   something always care more than the              18:57:17

                25   stakeholders gaining something.                  18:57:19





                                                               332



                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  The theory of regret.      18:57:19

                 2           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Right.                   18:57:19

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  That you have to deal      18:57:19

                 4   with regret created by a decision more than      18:57:23

                 5   the benefits created.                            18:57:23

                 6           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Then you've got one      18:57:26

                 7   that sits somewhere between a zero and minus     18:57:29

                 8   two.                                             18:57:32

                 9           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, that was just the    18:57:32

                10   same one shifted.  So you can ignore it.         18:57:34

                11           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.                    18:57:38

                12           DR. CRAWLEY:  While using that           18:57:42

                13   criteria, let's try -- I think in this case      18:57:49

                14   you would say the program of record -- oh,       18:57:52

                15   I'm sorry.                                       18:57:57

                16           Well, I think you'd say No. 2 was        18:58:02

                17   something like a minus one just because it       18:58:07

                18   will take so long and the investment will be     18:58:11

                19   so low --                                        18:58:14

                20           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Right.                   18:58:14

                21           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- that, you know, it      18:58:15

                22   will be difficult to maintain the skill base,    18:58:20

                23   and I think you'd assign the same score to       18:58:23

                24   the other constrained budget case, No. 3B.       18:58:27

                25           Then you would go to 3B star -- 3B$,     18:58:30





                                                               333



                 1   and you would say, is the acceleration of the    18:58:38

                 2   program in that one going to create              18:58:44

                 3   significant? -- so I guess that probably goes    18:58:48

                 4   to something like a zero, which is defined in    18:58:48

                 5   the rubric as maintains selected critical        18:58:52

                 6   skills and experience.                           18:58:57

                 7           MR. GREASON:  None of these options,     18:58:59

                 8   with the exception of 5, do we get rid of the    18:59:01

                 9   big gap in operation of shuttle heritage         18:59:06

                10   systems.                                         18:59:10

                11           And so, yeah, there are things that      18:59:11

                12   are accelerating, but, you know, the only        18:59:13

                13   things that you're afraid of losing in those     18:59:16

                14   scenarios, you have to be afraid of losing       18:59:19

                15   whether you spend more money or less.            18:59:22

                16           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, but to a certain     18:59:24

                17   extent -- Sally has just left the room.  To a    18:59:26

                18   certain extent, that -- we've put in the         18:59:30

                19   carrying costs in order to keep those            18:59:32

                20   capabilities alive.  The consistent thing        18:59:34

                21   would be to give it credit for keeping them      18:59:38

                22   alive.                                           18:59:42

                23           MR. GREASON:  But this is about          18:59:46

                24   critical skills, and the skill we're talking     18:59:46

                25   about is the skill of operations.  And I         18:59:46





                                                               334



                 1   don't know, as an operator, whether --           18:59:46

                 2           MR. AUGUSTINE:  That's an important      18:59:54

                 3   point.  I think that's right.  I think you       18:59:54

                 4   take it down.                                    19:00:03

                 5           MR. GREASON:  I mean, if I -- I think    19:00:03

                 6   this is the case where there's -- you know,      19:00:03

                 7   if -- the only thing that scores high on this    19:00:03

                 8   is the shuttle exception, because that's the     19:00:15

                 9   only scenario in which you don't have people     19:00:15

                10   standing around for five years going I wonder    19:00:15

                11   if I remember how to do this.                    19:00:15

                12           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah.  That's true.          19:00:15

                13           MR. AUGUSTINE:  You're probably          19:00:24

                14   right.                                           19:00:24

                15           DR. CRAWLEY:  So you'd make the          19:00:24

                16   shuttle extension a zero.                        19:00:24

                17           MR. GREASON:  Or a one maybe.  I         19:00:24

                18   don't -- yeah, a zero.                           19:00:24

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  A zero.                    19:00:24

                20           MR. GREASON:  Because it just            19:00:32

                21   maintains.  This doesn't do any improvement.     19:00:32

                22           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Baseline.                19:00:32

                23           DR. CHIAO:  Right.                       19:00:32

                24           DR. CRAWLEY:  And you would move the     19:00:32

                25   3B$ to a minus one because of the gap --         19:00:32





                                                               335



                 1           MR. GREASON:  Uh-huh.                    19:00:32

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- is what you're          19:00:40

                 3   saying.  And the other ones would be minus       19:00:40

                 4   ones probably as well, right?                    19:00:44

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Right.  It's the only    19:00:47

                 6   one that doesn't continue the shuttle.           19:00:47

                 7           DR. CRAWLEY:  If the criteria is the     19:00:55

                 8   worse thing that happens.                        19:00:55

                 9           So let me try reading you that.  Now,    19:01:02

                10   before we go off of that, is it really true      19:01:06

                11   that when you defined this, Norm, as critical    19:01:12

                12   skills -- critical national skills that you      19:01:15

                13   were thinking about the operational --           19:01:18

                14           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, that was one of    19:01:20

                15   the many things.  It would be can we power       19:01:22

                16   large solid propellant rocket motors, things     19:01:25

                17   of that type.                                    19:01:29

                18           DR. RIDE:  But I think --                19:01:32

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  If you made a short        19:01:33

                20   list, we could test the hypothesis that these    19:01:37

                21   should all be minus ones.  Because, I mean,      19:01:39

                22   some have the solid rocket motors and some       19:01:42

                23   don't.  So if you thought that was on your       19:01:44

                24   list of key skills --                            19:01:46

                25           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Maybe they're all --     19:01:48





                                                               336



                 1           DR. RIDE:  You shouldn't                 19:01:48

                 2   underestimate the operational skills.            19:01:51

                 3           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah.                        19:01:51

                 4           DR. RIDE:  That's --                     19:01:51

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  It's a big one.          19:01:51

                 6           DR. RIDE:  That's a big one.  That's     19:01:54

                 7   hard stuff.                                      19:02:00

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, I understand.  I     19:02:00

                 9   also know that from 1973 to 1981 there was       19:02:00

                10   one five-day mission and we -- ASTP.             19:02:06

                11           DR. CHIAO:  Well, it doesn't mean        19:02:11

                12   it's not overcomable, but it's an impact.        19:02:16

                13           MR. GREASON:  All technologies that      19:02:16

                14   you lose, if you want them badly enough, you     19:02:16

                15   can get them back.                               19:02:16

                16           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Eventually.              19:02:18

                17           DR. CHIAO:  Yeah, eventually.            19:02:18

                18           MR. AUGUSTINE:  All right.  Ed, to       19:02:18

                19   maintain your point, you might --                19:02:20

                20           DR. CRAWLEY:  I was just making sure     19:02:24

                21   that in our discussion there we didn't just      19:02:24

                22   focus on one key skill.                          19:02:29

                23           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Maybe that -- it's a     19:02:29

                24   minus one.  Everything else is a minus two.      19:02:34

                25           DR. AUSTIN:  I was going to offer to up  19:02:34





                                                               337



                 1   that --                                          19:02:34

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, that's not going     19:02:34

                 3   to differentiate --                              19:02:34

                 4           DR. AUSTIN:  -- that maybe we need to    19:02:39

                 5   amend the description to really focus on the     19:02:39

                 6   operational skills if that's what we're          19:02:39

                 7   worried about.  Because I think if you           19:02:45

                 8   generically say critical skills -- I know        19:02:45

                 9   what comes to my mind is more engineering        19:02:45

                10   skills, technical skills that you need --        19:02:49

                11           MR. McALISTER:  For development.         19:02:49

                12           DR. AUSTIN:  -- yeah -- for              19:02:49

                13   development.                                     19:02:52

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  I mean, if you      19:02:52

                15   look -- if you look at the criteria that we      19:02:55

                16   elaborated that go with this, it reads           19:02:56

                17   potential to sustain key industrial              19:03:02

                18   workforce, which could be interpreted many       19:03:02

                19   ways, the potential to engage the appropriate    19:03:04

                20   scientific and engineering resources of the      19:03:06

                21   nation and the potential for a sustainability    19:03:07

                22   workforce in the maintenance of high quality     19:03:12

                23   stable employment in the technical workforce.    19:03:15

                24           So it's -- as you said, it's a little    19:03:17

                25   more broad.                                      19:03:19





                                                               338



                 1           MR. GREASON:  Not to make a complex      19:03:19

                 2   problem more complex, but we also have on the    19:03:22

                 3   scoring sheet this thing about attracting and    19:03:26

                 4   retaining a highly capable technical             19:03:28

                 5   workforce.                                       19:03:28

                 6           And how do you cope with the fact        19:03:32

                 7   that there is a duality that if we turn off      19:03:34

                 8   old things so that we can do new things, the     19:03:38

                 9   graduating engineers are going to go, great,     19:03:41

                10   I get to come in and work on a program that      19:03:42

                11   does all kinds of new things, which is a good    19:03:43

                12   things, but it goes along with the fact that     19:03:46

                13   there are some old things you're not going to    19:03:46

                14   do anymore, that's a negative.                   19:03:51

                15           I guess I'm questioning Norm's           19:03:53

                16   statement, before he gets out of earshot         19:03:56

                17   here, that you just take the minimum of all      19:03:56

                18   possible scoring criteria and say whatever is    19:04:01

                19   the worse thing is what you score.               19:04:02

                20           DR. CRAWLEY:  Well, I haven't heard a    19:04:09

                21   better suggestion than the one we had before     19:04:15

                22   I raised the objection.  So let me tell          19:04:17

                23   you --                                           19:04:20

                24           DR. CHIAO:  Do you want to retract       19:04:20

                25   your objection?                                  19:04:22





                                                               339



                 1           DR. CRAWLEY:  I'll retract my            19:04:23

                 2   objection.                                       19:04:24

                 3           DR. RIDE:  All in favor?                 19:04:24

                 4           DR. CRAWLEY:  Since I made it, I can     19:04:25

                 5   retract it.                                      19:04:27

                 6           So let me tell you what I think we       19:04:28

                 7   scored there, which is on item 2 -- Option 2     19:04:31

                 8   it was minus one.  On Option 4 it was a minus    19:04:34

                 9   one.

                10           DR. AUSTIN:  Option 4.

                11           DR. CRAWLEY:  I'm sorry.  I'm

                12   starting to get --

                13           MR. McALISTER:  3B.

                14           DR. CRAWLEY:  Option 3B, which is on     19:04:46

                15   line 4, it's a minus one.  Option 3B$ is a       19:04:48

                16   minus one.  Option 5$ is a zero.  Option 6$      19:04:52

                17   is a minus one.  7$ is a minus one.  And 7S$     19:04:59

                18   is a minus one.                                  19:05:08

                19           Now, we agreed that we would use a       19:05:08

                20   rule on the workforce just like we used a        19:05:12

                21   rule on science, which is basically to scale     19:05:17

                22   it off the total expenditure or the              19:05:23

                23   principal.  The way to make jobs is to spend     19:05:23

                24   money, and you can't make jobs -- well,          19:05:27

                25   there's an efficiency argument.                  19:05:30





                                                               340



                 1           Now, let's talk for a minute about       19:05:35

                 2   the last two, which we left blank, and just      19:05:35

                 3   make sure that we're comfortable with taking     19:05:38

                 4   the outcomes of the Aerospace analysis and       19:05:42

                 5   using it to inform these.                        19:05:46

                 6           Sally, do you want to -- you're the      19:05:51

                 7   one who knows that the best.  Do you want to     19:05:52

                 8   comment on that?                                 19:05:55

                 9           In other words, it would go to the       19:05:55

                10   fact of -- let's take schedule for a minute.     19:05:55

                11   Is this schedule performance, or is this --      19:05:59

                12   you know, is this sort of confidence in the      19:06:01

                13   schedule and risk?                               19:06:05

                14           DR. RIDE:  You know, it's -- the way     19:06:07

                15   that the scenarios will come out is they'll      19:06:10

                16   spit out a budget that the methodology           19:06:16

                17   believes will give you 65 percent confidence     19:06:21

                18   of making that.                                  19:06:26

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     19:06:26

                20           DR. RIDE:  So it will not                19:06:27

                21   discriminate between these two.                  19:06:29

                22           Do you agree with that, Wanda?           19:06:32

                23           DR. AUSTIN:  Yes, I do.  Absolutely.     19:06:33

                24           DR. RIDE:  And similarly -- so I         19:06:35

                25   would say that it's not going to be -- it's      19:06:40





                                                               341



                 1   not going to be a way to discriminate --         19:06:42

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     19:06:46

                 3           DR. RIDE:  -- between --                 19:06:46

                 4           DR. CRAWLEY:  In other words, the        19:06:46

                 5   schedule dates will be at a consistent level     19:06:46

                 6   of --                                            19:06:50

                 7           DR. RIDE:  Yes.                          19:06:50

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- predictable risk?       19:06:53

                 9           DR. AUSTIN:  Yeah.  But the schedule     19:06:55

                10   that we had in the rubrics here was when do      19:06:55

                11   you get human lunar return, when do you get      19:06:55

                12   beyond LEO.                                      19:06:58

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yes.  That's right.  So    19:06:58

                14   it's the absolute answers.                       19:06:59

                15           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        19:07:03

                16           DR. AUSTIN:  Yeah.  So once you have     19:07:03

                17   that data, then you can say, hey, this --        19:07:04

                18           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     19:07:04

                19           DR. AUSTIN:  -- comes too late,          19:07:06

                20   therefore --                                     19:07:08

                21           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  Let's go back       19:07:08

                22   and look at that.                                19:07:09

                23           DR. CHIAO:  Every one is going to get    19:07:09

                24   a negative one or two.                           19:07:09

                25           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  And those will --      19:07:13





                                                               342



                 1           DR. AUSTIN:  Right.                      19:07:13

                 2           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  Actually you're    19:07:13

                 3   right.                                           19:07:15

                 4           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        19:07:15

                 5           DR. CRAWLEY:  So the schedule rubrics    19:07:15

                 6   are associated with dates of key events --       19:07:17

                 7           DR. AUSTIN:  Right.                      19:07:17

                 8           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- at the 65 percent       19:07:23

                 9   confidence level, which is what the analysis     19:07:23

                10   will produce.  And the life cycle cost is        19:07:28

                11   relevant to the budget.                          19:07:28

                12           MR. BEJMUK:  It's a little more than     19:07:31

                13   that, Ed, it seems like.  I think what these     19:07:31

                14   ladies are saying is exactly right.  You         19:07:31

                15   know, here's a schedule with a 65 percent        19:07:34

                16   probability, and that's great.                   19:07:39

                17           I think more important for us is to      19:07:39

                18   judge on the basis -- do you get Ares I by       19:07:43

                19   the time ISS is still in orbit or does it        19:07:46

                20   come after it went into the drink.  That, to     19:07:51

                21   me -- that aspect is more important in           19:07:56

                22   judging these scenarios.  Do we -- you           19:08:05

                23   know --                                          19:08:05

                24           MR. GREASON:  You eliminated a           19:08:05

                25   scenario that's already --                       19:08:05





                                                               343



                 1           MR. BEJMUK:  -- you're making up         19:08:05

                 2   things that are built for a function and the     19:08:05

                 3   function is gone, you know.  And I don't know    19:08:10

                 4   if we have -- we had cases today in Sally's      19:08:10

                 5   presentations --                                 19:08:19

                 6           DR. RIDE:  We did.  I think those are    19:08:19

                 7   gone though.  I think.                           19:08:19

                 8           MR. BEJMUK:  They're all gone?  The      19:08:19

                 9   ones that didn't make sense --                   19:08:19

                10           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  They didn't make       19:08:19

                11   sense, and so they -- they just didn't hold      19:08:19

                12   together is all.                                 19:08:23

                13           MR. BEJMUK:  Okay.  So we don't have     19:08:23

                14   to worry about that.                             19:08:23

                15           DR. RIDE:  I don't think we have         19:08:23

                16   any --                                           19:08:23

                17           MR. GREASON:  To the best of our         19:08:28

                18   ability, we don't have any of those left --      19:08:28

                19           DR. RIDE:  Right.                        19:08:28

                20           MR. GREASON:  -- the ones that didn't    19:08:28

                21   make sense.                                      19:08:32

                22           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         19:08:32

                23           MR. BEJMUK:  Okay.  Good.                19:08:32

                24           DR. RIDE:  It's hard to tell from        19:08:32

                25   this sheet.                                      19:08:34





                                                               344



                 1           MR. GREASON:  Yeah.  Right now           19:08:34

                 2   nothing is making a lot of sense but --          19:08:36

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  We're deliberating in a    19:08:39

                 4   public meeting, so this is a good discussion.    19:08:41

                 5           DR. RIDE:  All good.                     19:08:44

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  So it seems to me that,    19:08:44

                 7   as Wanda points out, if you actually look at     19:08:46

                 8   the rubrics on Charts 12 and 13 that this is     19:08:48

                 9   information that you could pretty readily        19:08:53

                10   read off the Aerospace analysis.                 19:08:54

                11           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.                         19:08:54

                12           MR. GREASON:  I agree.                   19:08:54

                13           DR. CRAWLEY:  So it's fair to leave      19:08:56

                14   those to be based on rule.                       19:08:59

                15           DR. AUSTIN:  I think so.                 19:09:01

                16           DR. RIDE:  Good.                         19:09:03

                17           DR. CRAWLEY:  Okay.  So,                 19:09:03

                18   Mr. Chairman, I think we're done.                19:09:05

                19           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I thought you were       19:09:08

                20   playing bingo out there.  You won.               19:09:13

                21           DR. CRAWLEY:  We have -- why don't we    19:09:17

                22   just summarize.  Without actually reading any    19:09:17

                23   specific numbers, we have agreed to ratings      19:09:22

                24   under Exploration Preparation, Technology        19:09:24

                25   Innovation, Human Civilization, Economic         19:09:25

                 1   Expansion, Public Engagement and Inspiration,    19:09:29

                 2   Global Partnerships, Programmatic                19:09:33

                 3   Sustainability, then this slightly redefined     19:09:35

                 4   Safety Challenge and National Skills.            19:09:39

                 5           And we have agreed to basically use a    19:09:42

                 6   schedule or budget-driven set of rules for       19:09:46

                 7   Science Knowledge, Workforce, Schedule and       19:09:50

                 8   Life Cycle Costs, which will be driven by the    19:09:56

                 9   output of the independent costing analysis.      19:10:00

                10           MR. AUGUSTINE:  I think that's well      19:10:04

                11   done.                                            19:10:06

                12           And I have one other thing that I        19:10:06

                13   hesitate to raise, but just as we had a          19:10:09

                14   Case 10 that we said we would discuss, I         19:10:14

                15   think there's a Case Zero that we've got to      19:10:17

                16   put on here, which basically is the program      19:10:23

                17   of record.                                       19:10:25

                18           In other words, it's hard to ignore      19:10:27

                19   the program that exists, but then we will --     19:10:27

                20   in all of the boxes where you would score it,    19:10:29

                21   we would put not executable.  We'll just put     19:10:33

                22   the words Not Executable or something,           19:10:36

                23   because I don't think we can ignore the          19:10:39

                24   program that's the program that's funded         19:10:41

                25   today that people are working to.                19:10:43

                 1           MR. GREASON:  Right.  Our notes said     19:10:46

                 2   that was -- go ahead.                            19:10:46

                 3           DR. CRAWLEY:  That's right.  There is    19:10:46

                 4   actually two reference cases that we'll have.    19:10:46

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.                    19:10:46

                 6           DR. CRAWLEY:  The program of record      19:10:49

                 7   unconstrained and the program of record with     19:10:51

                 8   the plus-up budget level, which very closely     19:10:56

                 9   re-covers the --                                 19:11:00

                10           MR. AUGUSTINE:  No.  I'm talking         19:11:00

                11   about a forward record, not adjusted for         19:11:01

                12   risk, not -- it's just the way that it is        19:11:03

                13   today with -- you allegedly end the shuttle      19:11:09

                14   in 2010, 2015 ISS, no money to splash the        19:11:17

                15   space station and so on, that --                 19:11:23

                16           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     19:11:23

                17           MR. AUGUSTINE:  And it has today's       19:11:23

                18   budget.                                          19:11:25

                19           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.                     19:11:25

                20           MR. AUGUSTINE:  We ought to show that    19:11:25

                21   here somewhere --                                19:11:29

                22           DR. CRAWLEY:  Yeah.  That's right.       19:11:29

                23           MR. AUGUSTINE:  -- that would just       19:11:29

                24   put it as not executable.                        19:11:29

                25           DR. CRAWLEY:  And you're absolutely      19:11:32





                                                               347



                 1   right.  And, in fact, you'll remember that,      19:11:32

                 2   heaven forbid, the longer version of this        19:11:35

                 3   list actually had three cases that we had        19:11:37

                 4   agreed at our meeting last week that we were     19:11:42

                 5   going to show for reference.                     19:11:42

                 6           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Exactly.                 19:11:42

                 7           DR. CRAWLEY:  Which were the -- which    19:11:46

                 8   was exactly the program of record and two        19:11:46

                 9   variants, I think the program which had been     19:11:52

                10   originally designed in the 2007 time             19:11:58

                11   period, the sort of post-ESAS record, and        19:12:01

                12   there was another one I can't remember, but      19:12:01

                13   it would certainly be there.                     19:12:03

                14           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Okay.  I think we're     19:12:06

                15   getting near the end here.                       19:12:06

                16           Does anybody --                          19:12:10

                17           DR. CRAWLEY:  Before we leave this, I    19:12:11

                18   think we just want to, in the public meeting,    19:12:18

                19   reiterate that if in the course of the           19:12:18

                20   deliberations and -- additional information      19:12:18

                21   that comes to us in the next days -- or as       19:12:22

                22   we're writing our report, you know, there's      19:12:22

                23   information that would cause us to change        19:12:29

                24   this slightly, I think the committee should      19:12:29

                25   reserve the right to do that.                    19:12:34





                                                               348



                 1           MR. AUGUSTINE:  You know, I think if     19:12:34

                 2   there's new factual information we obviously     19:12:34

                 3   would reflect that.  If there's just a new --    19:12:39

                 4           DR. CRAWLEY:  Right.  But I think        19:12:46

                 5   that in this public meeting the logic and        19:12:46

                 6   thought process that we used to arrive at        19:12:46

                 7   this was sufficiently explained that if new      19:12:51

                 8   information comes along we --                    19:12:51

                 9           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Reflect it.              19:12:56

                10           DR. CRAWLEY:  -- we should reflect       19:12:56

                11   it.                                              19:12:56

                12           DR. RIDE:  Yeah.  I think I'd also       19:12:56

                13   like to just get on record in the public         19:13:03

                14   meeting that I think that what we would like     19:13:03

                15   to do in running the budget scenarios further    19:13:08

                16   is use our judgment, based on the data that      19:13:10

                17   comes out of these, to determine which ones      19:13:14

                18   we need to run again to get more fidelity        19:13:17

                19   when we've learned the most we think we can      19:13:20

                20   reasonably learn with a particular scenario,     19:13:25

                21   you know, so that we've got some closure on      19:13:29

                22   this.                                            19:13:32

                23           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Well, that sounds        19:13:32

                24   very good.  And what I would suggest -- we're    19:13:38

                25   supposed to meet tomorrow at 8:00.  I would      19:13:38





                                                               349



                 1   suggest we slip that to 9:00 to give us time     19:13:38

                 2   to do our homework tonight so we'll be ready     19:13:38

                 3   to go -- we're losing Ed now -- so that --       19:13:46

                 4           DR. RIDE:  Our homework?                 19:13:46

                 5           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Yeah.                    19:13:46

                 6           DR. CHIAO:  Our homework.                19:13:51

                 7           DR. CRAWLEY:  Dr. Ride and I have        19:13:51

                 8   agreed there's no homework tonight.              19:13:53

                 9           MR. AUGUSTINE:  No, Professor, there     19:13:53

                10   is homework.  So we can do our homework this     19:13:55

                11   evening, and we'll start at 9:00 tomorrow.       19:14:01

                12           Would you mind alerting by e-mail or     19:14:06

                13   Blackberry or whatever those who are not here    19:14:06

                14   that we'll plan to start at 9:00, if that's      19:14:09

                15   all right, unless somebody wants to start        19:14:13

                16   earlier?                                         19:14:15

                17           MR. McALISTER:  And just for             19:14:15

                18   clarification, that's not a -- tomorrow at       19:14:16

                19   9:00 is not a committee meeting.  We're just     19:14:17

                20   getting together to write the final report       19:14:17

                21   and to clean up our various activities.          19:14:20

                22   There will be no deliberations, and it's not     19:14:22

                23   going to be in a public forum.                   19:14:25

                24           MR. AUGUSTINE:  Good point.  I'm glad    19:14:31

                25   you said that.                                   19:14:31

                 1           Well, to all of you who stuck with us    19:14:31

                 2   all of this time, congratulations, you           19:14:41

                 3   deserve some kind of an award.  That's the       19:14:41
